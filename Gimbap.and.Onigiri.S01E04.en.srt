1
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:54,576
Good morning.

2
00:00:57,495 --> 00:00:58,830
Good morning.

3
00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:14,262
Here. Enjoy.

4
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:17,140
Everything looks delicious.

5
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,267
I can really eat all this?

6
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,226
Yeah.

7
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,562
Because I'm not going home for Chuseok,

8
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:24,898
eomma brought me tons of side dishes

9
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:26,858
and snacks that I love.

10
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:30,236
Chuseok?

11
00:01:34,324 --> 00:01:36,743
It's kind of like Obon in Japan.

12
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:39,037
I see.

13
00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:42,206
Speaking of which,
are you going home for Obon?

14
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,465
I'm still thinking about it.

15
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:56,012
Let's eat before it gets cold.

16
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:59,224
Thank you for the food.

17
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:01,726
Thank you for the food.

18
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:08,816
This is good.

19
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:16,824
Kkulmat.

20
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,580
What? Was that wrong?

21
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:25,083
That's what you say
when it's delicious, right--

22
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:27,669
Kkulmat?

23
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:28,962
Yeah, that!

24
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:32,006
That's right. It's right, but…

25
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,050
You're too cute.

26
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:38,012
The fact that you're
trying to remember Korean words

27
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:39,514
makes me happy.

28
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:41,599
I'm glad.

29
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:44,269
Let's eat.

30
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:51,067
I ate a little too much.

31
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:55,029
You basically ate
all the seaweed soup, after all.

32
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:14,716
Oh, sorry! I couldn't help myself…

33
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:18,761
Did you want one too?

34
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:20,096
Huh?

35
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:21,389
All right…

36
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:25,560
I'll shu… sho…

37
00:03:26,811 --> 00:03:28,229
I'll share some with you.

38
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:30,732
Thank you.

39
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:33,026
NURUNGJI

40
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:36,988
Can I ask what flavor this is?

41
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,034
A warm flavor.

42
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,244
A warm flavor?

43
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:46,581
This is my favorite candy.

44
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:49,292
It lifts my spirits
especially when I'm feeling down,

45
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,835
so you have to try it.

46
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:53,087
I'll look forward to it.

47
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:57,342
Thank you for sharing
such a precious candy with me.

48
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,681
What's wrong?

49
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:49,644
BIG BRO

50
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:57,693
Hello?

51
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:08,079
This is route number TE301.

52
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:11,249
Last stop is Nagano Station.

53
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:16,045
We will arrive at Nagano Station

54
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,673
at approximately 5:05.

55
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:24,846
We will now turn off the lights…

56
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:45,343
- You can do it!
- Taiga!

57
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:48,221
- Run! Go!
- Run Taiga!

58
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:49,263
You can do it!

59
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:51,057
Taiga!

60
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:05,071
Taiga.

61
00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:06,781
You're off the team.

62
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,585
Don't look so depressed.

63
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:23,256
You were just a reserve member
this one time.

64
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:25,383
I'm not depressed…

65
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:29,804
If you have the time to be sulking,

66
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:32,139
shouldn't you be practicing?

67
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,717
Food is ready. Eat up.

68
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,385
- Thank you.
- All right.

69
00:08:14,432 --> 00:08:16,225
I made the onigiri small for you.

70
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:17,518
It's easier to eat that way.

71
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,772
Right? Make sure you eat a lot.

72
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:23,858
Here. Do your best.

73
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:25,192
Thank you.

74
00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:27,737
Just don't get hurt.

75
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,577
Forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine,

76
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,537
fifty, fifty-one…

77
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:52,595
- Bye, Taiga.
- Bye.

78
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:53,554
Bye.

79
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:56,307
- Coach says he's treating us today.
- No way!

80
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:58,434
How much will that be?

81
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:14,659
5000 meters.

82
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:16,494
Ready… Go!

83
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:26,587
Forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty, fifty-one…

84
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:28,923
First place, 13 minutes 51 seconds.

85
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:45,690
Coach.

86
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,110
Taiga.

87
00:09:52,196 --> 00:09:54,323
I understand that you're working hard.

88
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,075
But you know…

89
00:09:57,868 --> 00:09:59,036
you're not the only one

90
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:01,622
who is working hard.

91
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:12,550
21. HASE TAIGA

92
00:10:19,223 --> 00:10:22,518
The dorm cafeteria is understaffed.

93
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:26,021
So from now on, go and help them.

94
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:32,528
- Man, that's brutal.
- The cafeteria?

95
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:33,446
Poor guy.

96
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,948
He got an endorsement and he's a reserve?

97
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:40,327
You don't have to come out.

98
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:42,997
I'll contact you once I get to Tokyo.

99
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,083
Taiga.

100
00:10:48,836 --> 00:10:50,546
Are you really sure?

101
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:53,174
Huh?

102
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,593
You know,

103
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:58,012
you've loved running
since you were a child.

104
00:10:58,095 --> 00:11:00,765
You would run around all day if I let you.

105
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:03,225
I bet you still want to run--

106
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:05,144
Enough about track.

107
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:13,694
There are a ton of people who are
on a completely different level than me.

108
00:11:15,237 --> 00:11:17,907
I tried to run as fast as I could,
but it was pointless.

109
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,910
Just "liking" it…

110
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,954
was not enough.

111
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:29,752
That's all there is to it.

112
00:11:31,378 --> 00:11:33,047
Don't make me talk about it anymore.

113
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:35,090
Okay…

114
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:37,968
You're right…

115
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:42,723
It's okay.

116
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:44,934
You didn't fail.

117
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,978
You have a whole life ahead of you.

118
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:51,232
Don't be anxious.

119
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:55,110
Find something only you can do,
and do it at your own pace.

120
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:57,821
I'm sure…

121
00:11:59,114 --> 00:12:02,535
As long as you try your best,
that's enough.

122
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,876
Bye.

123
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:35,711
Welcome home!

124
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:37,338
Taiga!

125
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:40,007
I'm home.

126
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:46,096
You don't have time.
Hurry and get changed.

127
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:52,645
Well then…

128
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:55,189
I'd like to thank everyone

129
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:57,775
who took time out of their busy schedules
to be here

130
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,818
for our father's 13th anniversary.

131
00:14:01,111 --> 00:14:01,945
May he rest in peace.

132
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:03,364
- May he rest in peace.
- May he rest in peace.

133
00:14:08,786 --> 00:14:09,620
Yuji,

134
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:12,039
- thank you for today.
- No, thank you.

135
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,876
I must say, Masa, I'm so glad

136
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,461
- I asked you for help.
- It was nothing.

137
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:19,046
Good thing you did.

138
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:22,967
Although, it is more than
90% a loan rather than "my home."

139
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,303
- That can't be helped.
- But I think you bought at a good time.

140
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:29,014
The interest rates
and price of land were low.

141
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:31,892
Hey, Haruto.

142
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:34,979
- If Masa says so, that must be true.
- Yeah.

143
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:37,690
- Right?
- If it's Masa.

144
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,650
- Come here.
- You should all go to him for help.

145
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:40,943
That's right.

146
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:45,239
As expected…

147
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:46,740
Come over here. Up we go.

148
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:52,371
REMARKABLE!
RENEWS HIGHEST RANKING FOR THE PREFECTURE

149
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,158
I'll help.

150
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:31,910
Thank you.

151
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:54,850
Dad liked wood ear mushrooms, didn't he?

152
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:04,985
Oh!

153
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:07,029
You're good!

154
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:08,781
I do this every day.

155
00:16:13,243 --> 00:16:15,037
- I'll take this.
- Sure.

156
00:16:53,992 --> 00:16:54,910
So?

157
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,538
Huh?

158
00:16:58,122 --> 00:17:00,749
What are you planning to do
with your life?

159
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:06,463
Actually,

160
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:10,467
the restaurant I'm working at right now
is pretty nice.

161
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:15,347
You said it was
a privately run izakaya, right?

162
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:16,765
Yeah.

163
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:19,726
The owner and I run it on our own.

164
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:22,563
And he relies on me a lot.

165
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,316
You're the only part-timer?

166
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:28,527
Yeah.

167
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,779
Come on, he relies on you

168
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:33,115
because he has nobody else.

169
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:36,910
Don't get the wrong idea.

170
00:17:38,996 --> 00:17:41,415
Anyone can do your job.

171
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,340
- Dad!
- What's wrong?

172
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:54,094
You little baby. Up we go. All right.

173
00:17:54,178 --> 00:17:57,556
Where's your mom? Let's go.

174
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:06,732
But I guess what he said is right.

175
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:08,942
No offense to your brother,

176
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:11,195
but I think he's wrong.

177
00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:16,283
Both Tanomi, and the owner
really need you.

178
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:19,578
You think so?

179
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:22,873
Not only are you a good cook,

180
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:26,126
but you're also good
at explaining the menu,

181
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,503
and you're always smiling,
no matter how busy it is.

182
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,468
But it doesn't have to be me…

183
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:38,347
Just like he said, anybody can do that.

184
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:40,599
That's not true.

185
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,394
I don't think many people

186
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:47,022
can keep that attitude up day after day,

187
00:18:47,522 --> 00:18:48,982
like it's nothing.

188
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:52,778
It's something to be proud of. I know it.

189
00:18:57,366 --> 00:19:00,535
Being consistent
over a long period of time,

190
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:03,288
is the most powerful trait.

191
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:05,290
Am I wrong?

192
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:27,479
I believe

193
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:31,233
that your training right now
will not be wasted.

194
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:01,847
NURUNGJI

195
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:13,859
She's right…

196
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:16,611
It's a warm flavor.

197
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:38,842
Hey, where were you? Hurry up and help us.

198
00:20:39,843 --> 00:20:40,969
Hey…

199
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:45,015
um…

200
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:49,936
Right now, I'm training.

201
00:20:50,937 --> 00:20:51,772
Huh?

202
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:54,066
It's true that right now,

203
00:20:54,691 --> 00:20:55,734
I'm just a part-timer

204
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:58,904
and the work that I'm doing

205
00:20:59,696 --> 00:21:02,866
can arguably be done by anybody.

206
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:05,369
But…

207
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,207
if I keep pursuing
this thing that anybody can do,

208
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,709
in the end…

209
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:18,006
I think it will turn into something
that only I can do.

210
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:22,803
That's why, right now,

211
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,348
I want to treasure
the days I spend training.

212
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:30,727
I want to make a steady effort,
and continue cooking.

213
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:34,689
I just…

214
00:21:36,858 --> 00:21:38,652
wanted to tell you that.

215
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,375
What if it falls through again?

216
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:55,335
What?

217
00:21:56,086 --> 00:21:58,964
Are you prepared to keep at it
until the very end?

218
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:01,967
Prepared?

219
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,431
That…

220
00:22:10,684 --> 00:22:11,852
I don't know.

221
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:18,525
In the end, you haven't changed at all.

222
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,613
If you dillydally,

223
00:22:23,697 --> 00:22:26,241
and continue something without resolve,
you're only wasting time.

224
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:30,954
Not to mention,
you already made a detour once.

225
00:22:53,268 --> 00:22:54,144
‪Who's that?

226
00:22:54,227 --> 00:22:55,437
My Senior.

227
00:22:58,773 --> 00:22:59,858
Nice to meet you.

228
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:01,902
I'm Kang Jun-ho.

229
00:23:03,945 --> 00:23:05,030
Let me carry those.

230
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:12,204
Thanks for coming
even though it's your day off.

231
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:14,247
It's nothing.

232
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:19,002
Jun-ho,

233
00:23:19,628 --> 00:23:21,379
are you dating anyone?

234
00:23:21,463 --> 00:23:22,547
What?

235
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:25,842
No, I'm not.

236
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:29,804
Well then, what do you do for work?

237
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:31,932
What are your parents like?

238
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:33,099
What do you like to eat?

239
00:23:33,183 --> 00:23:35,268
Mom, please stop.

240
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:36,436
I work

241
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:39,814
at a foreign-owned trading company.

242
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,775
My parents are civil servants.

243
00:23:41,858 --> 00:23:42,901
My hobby is playing soccer.

244
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:46,154
I love sundae gukbap.

245
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:48,198
Please ask me anything.

246
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:50,325
What is your MBTI type?

247
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:52,452
You know about MBTI too?

248
00:23:52,535 --> 00:23:53,912
What type of girl do you like?

249
00:23:53,995 --> 00:23:56,414
- Someone like you.
- You have good taste!

250
00:23:56,498 --> 00:23:57,666
NARITA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

251
00:23:57,749 --> 00:23:59,834
Jun-ho seems like a nice person.

252
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:02,629
You're not thinking about
doing anything weird, are you?

253
00:24:02,712 --> 00:24:05,966
Jun-ho and I are like brother and sister.

254
00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:13,265
I have something to say, so sit down.

255
00:24:18,687 --> 00:24:21,773
A part-time instructor position opened up

256
00:24:21,856 --> 00:24:24,109
at a vocational school
in Gyeonggi Province.

257
00:24:24,192 --> 00:24:27,696
Once you graduate, work there.

258
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:30,282
Wait a second.

259
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:35,245
I've been working hard
to become an animator.

260
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,454
I know that.

261
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:37,539
But you can't

262
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:41,751
become one
just because you want to, right?

263
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:44,296
And plus, you yourself

264
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:47,632
were saying that you don't know
if you have talent.

265
00:24:48,216 --> 00:24:49,634
Did you forget that?

266
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,222
Why do you have to go out of your way

267
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:57,392
to choose a difficult path?

268
00:25:00,854 --> 00:25:02,105
Rin, listen to me.

269
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:04,441
The most important thing

270
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:08,236
is to lead a stable life.

271
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,531
Trust your mother, okay?

272
00:25:11,614 --> 00:25:13,783
Just do as I say.

273
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:18,455
You only have half a year
until graduation anyway.

274
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:26,212
Taiga.

275
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:28,506
You don't have to rush.

276
00:25:33,636 --> 00:25:37,223
You don't have to do
anything extraordinary.

277
00:25:39,392 --> 00:25:42,354
You just do
what you can to the best of your ability.

278
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:48,443
Nobody…

279
00:25:50,236 --> 00:25:52,447
expects anything from me anymore, huh?

280
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:00,538
I think that hurts the most.

281
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:13,301
But Mom…

282
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:16,388
Thank you.

283
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:02,434
All right.

284
00:27:06,855 --> 00:27:07,814
Okay.

285
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,691
What?

286
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:12,235
Taiga? What's wrong?

287
00:27:12,318 --> 00:27:14,904
TANOMI

288
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,032
I wasn't able

289
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:21,494
to stand up to my mother or my brother.

290
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:25,790
Thank you.

291
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:30,253
My brother may be right…

292
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:33,715
In the end,

293
00:27:35,216 --> 00:27:36,968
I haven't changed.

294
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:40,722
No, I might actually be worse.

295
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:44,642
What do you mean?

296
00:27:47,395 --> 00:27:49,147
I'm 27 already,

297
00:27:49,772 --> 00:27:53,109
but I've accomplished nothing
and have nothing

298
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:55,737
to call my own.

299
00:27:57,864 --> 00:27:59,657
I'm so pathetic.

300
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:09,167
Taiga.

301
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:11,586
Do you have time tomorrow morning?

302
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:20,136

309
00:28:38,863 --> 00:28:39,739
Oh?

310
00:28:39,823 --> 00:28:41,658
- Shige?
- Hey.

311
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:43,243
You're not alone today?

312
00:28:43,326 --> 00:28:45,286
This is Taiga, he works at my place.

313
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,081
This is Mr. Nagamori,
who I've known for over 30 years.

314
00:28:48,665 --> 00:28:50,542
I'm Hase. Nice to meet you.

315
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,628
The one you've been talking about?

316
00:28:54,462 --> 00:28:56,214
I look forward to seeing more of you.

317
00:28:57,423 --> 00:28:59,634
- How's today's cabbage?
- They're from Tsumagoi.

318
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:04,013
- Hey, Ito.
- Hey, Shige.

319
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:05,473
What's in today?

320
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:09,102
Today, we have nice flounder from Aomori.

321
00:29:09,602 --> 00:29:11,813
- That's great. This must be…
- This is…

322
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:14,065
- Two kilograms?
- Yes, 2.6 kilograms.

323
00:29:14,148 --> 00:29:16,484
- 2.6?
- Yes. It's very fresh.

324
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:19,153
- I'll come by later.
- Okay. Thank you.

325
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:20,071
FOR TANOMI

326
00:29:20,738 --> 00:29:22,282
Here. Flying squid.

327
00:29:23,449 --> 00:29:24,742
For squid,

328
00:29:24,826 --> 00:29:28,413
you can tell that it's fresh
when it's dark and shiny, not faded.

329
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:30,290
I'll pay, so wait for me.

330
00:29:30,373 --> 00:29:32,542
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

331
00:30:26,262 --> 00:30:28,765
Everything was really cool.

332
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:32,894
You and everyone at the market.

333
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:38,733
I quit high school before graduating.

334
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:49,369
I started working as a cook
just to make ends meet.

335
00:30:50,995 --> 00:30:53,122
And I just kind of continued
down that path,

336
00:30:53,206 --> 00:30:54,999
and found myself here.

337
00:31:00,213 --> 00:31:02,966
Both people and things change.

338
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:10,473
Yesterday, you said that you had
nothing to call your own.

339
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:12,809
But is that really so?

340
00:31:31,285 --> 00:31:34,038
All right, should we get some
breakfast or something?

341
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:37,542
- Yes.
- Down we go.

342
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:41,379
Welcome back.

343
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:47,844
It's good to be back.

344
00:31:55,518 --> 00:31:57,103
When my family makes gimbap,

345
00:31:57,186 --> 00:31:59,605
we flavor the rice even before we cook it.

346
00:32:05,153 --> 00:32:07,697
What we put inside is not always the same.

347
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,198
But one thing we always include

348
00:32:09,282 --> 00:32:10,450
is bell pepper.

349
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,288
When I was a kid,

350
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:17,415
I didn't like eating vegetables,

351
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:21,252
so eomma cut them up finely
and put them in gimbap.

352
00:32:22,628 --> 00:32:24,797
In Korea, everyone brings gimbap

353
00:32:24,881 --> 00:32:27,508
on field trips and sports days.

354
00:32:29,677 --> 00:32:31,054
So on those days,

355
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:34,307
the whole house
smells good from morning and all day long.

356
00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:36,976
- Sounds like the best morning ever.
- Yeah.

357
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,979
So from the moment you wake up,

358
00:32:40,063 --> 00:32:42,356
you know that it's going to be a good day

359
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,233
and it puts a smile on your face.

360
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:46,277
‪Tada.

361
00:32:48,946 --> 00:32:50,073
Thank you for the food.

362
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:00,166
The Park family's gimbap is so kkulmat.

363
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:06,923
The takuan pickles
balance out the flavors perfectly.

364
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:08,049
I wonder what it is…

365
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,637
I feel like Korean takuan
has a more refreshing aftertaste.

366
00:33:15,473 --> 00:33:17,225
Maybe it has a stronger vinegar flavor.

367
00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:19,102
That's true.

368
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:21,896
That's why it goes so well with rice.

369
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:26,359
Sometimes we make them spicy
and eat it with rice too.

370
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:28,319
It's called danmuji muchim.

371
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:30,113
- I see.
- Yeah.

372
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:34,158
That's danmu… danmu?

373
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:37,620
Danmuji muchim.

374
00:33:37,703 --> 00:33:39,372
Da… danmujimuchim…

375
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:42,208
- Danmuji muchim.
- Danmuji mu…?

376
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:44,544
- Danmuji…
- Danmuji…?

377
00:33:44,627 --> 00:33:46,504
- muchim.
- muchim.

378
00:33:52,885 --> 00:33:54,512
That reminds me…

379
00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:56,597
How did it go with your brother?

380
00:33:59,058 --> 00:34:01,394
It didn't go well at all.

381
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:11,404
But you kind of look
like a weight has been lifted.

382
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,614
‪Yeah…

383
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:17,952
In the end, I'm glad that I went.

384
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:22,123
I was able to remember
things that I had forgotten too.

385
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:24,876
Like what?

386
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:29,505
Like how my mother made me

387
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:33,718
onigiri every day
when I had club activities.

388
00:34:34,218 --> 00:34:35,636
- Every day?
- Yeah.

389
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:40,349
I'm sure it was a lot of work for her too.

390
00:34:42,476 --> 00:34:44,729
Rather than thinking it's a lot of work,

391
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:49,108
I think she just wanted to make sure
that you weren't hungry.

392
00:34:56,782 --> 00:34:59,452
When I was making gimbap earlier,

393
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:02,038
that's what I was thinking.

394
00:35:03,122 --> 00:35:07,793
I wanted you to smile,
and say that it was delicious.

395
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:12,298
I'm sure your mother was the same.

396
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,135
Maybe…

397
00:35:17,345 --> 00:35:19,847
I understand that feeling too.

398
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,266
I…

399
00:35:23,184 --> 00:35:25,519
wasn't able to live up to my
family's expectations.

400
00:35:26,354 --> 00:35:29,774
So I think I always had feelings of guilt.

401
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:34,362
Family's expectations?

402
00:35:36,822 --> 00:35:38,366
I don't think that's right!

403
00:35:40,117 --> 00:35:41,702
What? What does that mean?

404
00:35:42,453 --> 00:35:44,330
I don't think it's right to push your

405
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:46,832
expectations on people,
or choose their future for them.

406
00:35:52,546 --> 00:35:53,756
Sorry…

407
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:57,385
Taiga, sorry for calling you
on your day off.

408
00:35:57,468 --> 00:35:58,970
The thing is, just now

409
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:02,431
I got a call from the hospital
saying that my older sister collapsed.

410
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:04,058
What?

411
00:36:04,642 --> 00:36:08,646
If possible, can you take care
of the restaurant for two or three days?

412
00:36:13,943 --> 00:36:16,195
Here's the flying squid sautéed
in butter and soy sauce.

413
00:36:17,029 --> 00:36:18,739
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

414
00:36:18,823 --> 00:36:21,117
- One oolong highball please.
- Okay.

415
00:36:27,164 --> 00:36:28,082
Welcome.

416
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:30,251
Working hard?

417
00:36:32,086 --> 00:36:33,713
It looks like your own restaurant!

418
00:36:33,796 --> 00:36:35,881
Oh, he is someone who is
always helping me.

419
00:36:35,965 --> 00:36:37,383
Mr. Sakumoto.

420
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:39,343
Hello, I'm Sakumoto.

421
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:43,055
Have a seat over here.

422
00:36:53,357 --> 00:36:55,401
- Here's your stewed Koya-dofu.
- Here it is!

423
00:36:55,484 --> 00:36:56,652
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

424
00:36:57,445 --> 00:36:59,905
The appetizer has a good kick to it
and is delicious.

425
00:37:01,282 --> 00:37:03,451
- Thank you.
- Wow, Taiga.

426
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:06,537
Mr. Sakumoto is an expert
when it comes to food.

427
00:37:07,413 --> 00:37:10,541
- Is this Korean style?
- Yes.

428
00:37:11,292 --> 00:37:12,752
It's called danmuji muchim.

429
00:37:12,835 --> 00:37:16,505
I mixed Korean takuan
with garlic and chili powder.

430
00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:21,218
At the end, I added a bit of sesame oil
to bring the flavors together.

431
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:29,894
I had heard from Mr. Ito
that you were a former athlete.

432
00:37:30,394 --> 00:37:32,396
I think that it's amazing how you have

433
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,273
found another path for yourself

434
00:37:34,357 --> 00:37:37,193
even after ending
your career as an athlete.

435
00:37:37,943 --> 00:37:39,945
It's not something that everyone can do.

436
00:37:40,654 --> 00:37:42,406
Please continue to do your best.

437
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:46,327
Thank you very much.

438
00:37:47,828 --> 00:37:49,205
Try the Koya-dofu.

439
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:54,835
‪TANOMI

440
00:37:57,588 --> 00:37:59,298
Thank you for treating me.

441
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:02,301
Thank you very much.

442
00:38:03,677 --> 00:38:05,262
I'm sorry I couldn't give this earlier…

443
00:38:09,517 --> 00:38:11,894
I work for a company called
Neo Meal Japan,

444
00:38:11,977 --> 00:38:15,398
and specialize in nutrition planning
and meal management for athletes.

445
00:38:15,898 --> 00:38:16,982
I see…

446
00:38:17,858 --> 00:38:19,777
- I hope to see you again.
- Bye.

447
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:21,987
Thank you.

448
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:35,501
- Taiga?
- Huh?

449
00:38:35,584 --> 00:38:36,627
PREVIEW

450
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,754
Are you proposing
to Onigiri Man or something?

451
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:40,798
You don't care if we're far apart, do you?

452
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:43,134
