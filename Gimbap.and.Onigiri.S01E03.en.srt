00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:53,449
MAMAMON

2
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,119
Mom?

3
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,539
Finally, you picked up!

4
00:01:01,457 --> 00:01:04,169
I don't hear from you at all lately!

5
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:07,130
How is your move going?

6
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:12,260
I'm working on it…

7
00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:16,264
Also, you don't need to come and help me
this time.

8
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,268
You don't need me to go?

9
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:24,898
Yeah. It's so sudden, anyway.

10
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:27,650
I have school too, so…

11
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:31,029
How can you move all by yourself!

12
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,364
I'm really okay.

13
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:35,283
I'll try to do what I can on my own.

14
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:46,502
Your application was accepted.

15
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,550
Thank you.

16
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:55,386
I will get all the contracts ready
as fast as I can.

17
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,304
Okay.

18
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:02,268
I GOT THE APARTMENT

19
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:04,062
YAY

20
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:08,316
KAEDE REAL ESTATE

21
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:13,238
I HOPE I CAN SIGN THE CONTRACT ON MY OWN.

22
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:14,155
I'M NERVOUS. I SIGNED IT!

23
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,574
Is he not on lunch break yet?

24
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:22,163
RIN

25
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,634
Taiga.

26
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,428
You should take a break when you can too.

27
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:38,471
Okay.

28
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,933
Shige.

29
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:44,727
How were this week's appetizers?

30
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,146
They were good.

31
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:51,818
I'll leave the appetizers
to you from now on.

32
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:55,113
- Okay! I'll do my best.
- Good.

33
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:56,030
TANOMI

34
00:03:00,743 --> 00:03:02,245
All right…

35
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:05,957
RIN

36
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:08,918
‪RIN

37
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:10,211
I'M NERVOUS.

38
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:11,379
I SIGNED IT!

39
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:21,824
Communication issues, huh?

40
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:28,664
You'd better solve that
as soon as you can.

41
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:34,128
This isn't the first time, right?

42
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:37,006
Why are you ignoring the problem?

43
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:41,260
If we take the time
to get to know each other,

44
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:43,888
won't these issues solve themselves?

45
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:45,473
Park Rin.

46
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:49,519
Are you going to eat the onigiri
one grain of rice at a time?

47
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:50,978
At this rate,

48
00:04:51,062 --> 00:04:54,899
you'll never find out
what the stuffing is.

49
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:59,320
But we just started dating.

50
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:01,531
If you're dating,

51
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:04,409
then stop stressing about it
all on your own,

52
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:07,120
and sink your teeth into Onigiri Man!

53
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:10,957
Okay?

54
00:05:23,886 --> 00:05:24,887
TANOMI

55
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:27,932
And ketchup for the pork chops.

56
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:30,476
- Okay.
- Here is the shopping list.

57
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,602
- Okay.
- Thanks.

58
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:33,688
Good evening.

59
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:38,276
Hey, Rin. Good to see you.

60
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,360
Welcome.

61
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:43,447
All right, then. Maybe I'll go home.

62
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,284
- I'll leave the rest to you.
- Okay. Good bye.

63
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,410
Bye.

64
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:50,746
Annyeong.

65
00:05:58,004 --> 00:05:59,463
Sorry for showing up so suddenly.

66
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:02,425
Just give me a second.

67
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:04,510
I'll be done soon. Come in.

68
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:17,523
I got my apartment.

69
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:22,653
What? That's great! Which one?

70
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:27,366
The last place we toured.

71
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:36,292
This place, huh?
That's great. Congratulations.

72
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,128
Thanks.

73
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:41,881
Wow…

74
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:45,301
What?

75
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:47,345
It's almost your birthday.

76
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:51,265
Yeah, it is.

77
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:58,397
I'll ask Shige if I can take that day off.

78
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,274
What? Really?

79
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:02,610
Let me celebrate it.

80
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,238
I'd love that.

81
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:08,908
But first, we have to celebrate
your new place.

82
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:10,701
Here it is.

83
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:13,287
How cute.

84
00:07:14,455 --> 00:07:15,998
RAMEN - OPEN

85
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:17,542
What a cool place.

86
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,335
You've never been to a ramen stand?

87
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:22,505
But I've seen them in anime.

88
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:24,799
Welcome.

89
00:07:24,882 --> 00:07:25,841
Let's sit down.

90
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:29,011
- For two, please.
- Two? Okay, have a seat.

91
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,057
- Two ramen and…
- Two ramen.

92
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:34,725
What do you want to drink?

93
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:37,144
I'll have a highball.

94
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:38,479
Two highballs please.

95
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:40,898
- Two highballs. Okay.
- Thank you.

96
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:50,575
Thanks for waiting. Here's your highball.

97
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:52,952
Thank you.

98
00:07:56,372 --> 00:07:57,832
Well then, cheers.

99
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:00,001
Cheers.

100
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:10,136
My photo of this stand is getting likes.

101
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:14,348
Social media?
Do you upload a lot of photos?

102
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:17,768
Things like food and doodles.

103
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,856
Did you draw that?

104
00:08:23,774 --> 00:08:25,484
These are by an artist that I love.

105
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:28,446
Every piece is so unique.

106
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:29,864
I've been a long-time fan.

107
00:08:31,365 --> 00:08:32,742
I see.

108
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:40,750
Anything else?

109
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,044
Do you want to ask me anything?

110
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:45,838
What?

111
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:51,218
I want you to get to know me better.

112
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:55,765
And I want to get to know you better too.

113
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:00,061
Did something happen?

114
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:07,151
Taiga, are you not that good
at keeping in touch?

115
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:16,202
When you don't read my messages,

116
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:18,204
or a day goes by without a word from you,

117
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:21,207
I start to wonder
if you have no interest in me.

118
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,126
I get worried.

119
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,970
Thanks for waiting. Here is your ramen.

120
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,639
NOODLE HOUSE MIYABI

121
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:38,724
Enjoy. Thanks for waiting.

122
00:09:38,808 --> 00:09:40,643
- Here is your ramen.
- Thank you.

123
00:09:45,272 --> 00:09:46,273
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:51,946
From now on,
I promise I'll contact you once a day.

125
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:57,827
Just once a day?

126
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:01,914
I didn't mean that literally.

127
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,209
What I mean is, I'll work on it.

128
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,341
Thank you.

129
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:15,970
Let's eat.

130
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:23,811
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

131
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:30,568
It's delicious.

132
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:38,033
Yeah, that's it.

133
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:42,955
Did you find it?

134
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,958
Thank goodness.

135
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,753
Can you hold onto it until the night?

136
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,880
Okay.

137
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:53,215
Bye. Oh, wait.

138
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:58,137
Sorry, this might be really random, but…

139
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,264
What? What is it?

140
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:02,266
What kind of gift

141
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,977
would make you happy?

142
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:06,395
Huh?

143
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:09,899
Well, it's almost Rin's birthday.

144
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,818
I was thinking about what to get,

145
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,197
but nothing really stood out.

146
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:21,118
Birthday, huh?

147
00:11:23,412 --> 00:11:26,457
There's no point
if someone tells you what to get.

148
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:31,545
Wouldn't she be happy to get something
that comes from your heart?

149
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:33,339
- You think so?
- Yeah.

150
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:36,008
Well…

151
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:38,511
The beginning stages of dating
are always fun.

152
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:40,095
So take your time and think.

153
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:44,391
I'll do that. Thanks. Bye.

154
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:51,232
Mom.

155
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:54,068
Mom, wake up.

156
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:57,988
- Noa?
- Drink water.

- Excuse me.
- Yes?

162
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:57,965
Do you have this?

163
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:02,386
We don't carry that. I'm sorry.

164
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:03,429
I see.

165
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:05,514
Excuse me.

166
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,642
I'm looking for this book.

167
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:12,521
I guess it's out-of-print,
and I can't find it anywhere.

168
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:26,493
All right.

169
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,132
- It's eomma…
- You don't need to answer it?

170
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:44,720
It's okay. It'll be a nightmare
if she finds out you're here.

171
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,305
I'll call her back later.

172
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,603
Taiga.

173
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,190
Can I move your stuff over there?

174
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:58,067
I'll do it!

175
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:13,082
Helping her move, huh?

176
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,252
Taiga is so the type
to pamper his girlfriend.

177
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:22,633
Not like some boyfriends out there
who do slots on pay day.

178
00:14:22,716 --> 00:14:23,550
Here.

179
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:25,052
- Have some oshinko.
- Thanks.

180
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:26,845
Welcome.

181
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:32,059
Go ahead and have a seat.

182
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,817
Please sit.

183
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:48,492
What is he saying?

184
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,869
He's asking if there's an English menu.

185
00:14:50,953 --> 00:14:52,121
We don't have that.

186
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:53,789
Of course we don't.

187
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:56,959
He's saying something…

188
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:14,643
Delicious.

189
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:20,190
Good, good…

190
00:15:24,695 --> 00:15:26,113
Thanks.

191
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:30,284
Should I make an English menu
or something?

192
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:32,786
That's true…

193
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,540
We get a lot of foreign customers lately,
so that would be great.

194
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:42,337
But don't expect too much.

195
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:44,757
- Of course I have high expectations.
- Don't.

196
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,425
In addition to English,

197
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:48,385
we need French,

198
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:51,346
- Italian, Spanish, Korean…
- No, no!

199
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:57,311
It's done!

200
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:01,148
Good work. Here.

201
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:02,566
Thank you.

202
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,492
This is my first time moving on my own.

203
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:14,661
So having you with me was very reassuring.

204
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:50,823
Hello, who's there?

205
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,377
Mom?!

206
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,754
Rin, it's your birthday tomorrow, right?

207
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,799
So I came here to see you.
Hurry up and open the door!

208
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,593
Give me a second.

209
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:14,596
My mom is here! What should I do?

210
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,058
- What?
- What should I do…

211
00:17:18,142 --> 00:17:19,393
- Rin?
- Oh no…

212
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:22,896
This way.

213
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:28,318
I missed you, Rin!

214
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:31,405
Good to see you, Mom.

215
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:33,448
I missed you so much.

216
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,166
You pretty much got everything organized.

217
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:45,335
I booked a hotel,
because I thought it would be a mess.

218
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:48,338
But at this rate,
I can stay here from tonight.

219
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:52,676
Rin, where's your bedroom? That way?

220
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:57,181
Mom! Mom!

221
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,811
What a nice room. It's so fluffy.

222
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:05,564
Rin, where's your extra futon?

223
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:07,774
Over here?

224
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:12,154
- Mom!
- What?

225
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:22,623
I'm so hungry…

226
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:26,627
Oh, you were hungry? Let's eat then!

227
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:29,671
But you know,

228
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:31,924
I'm so glad.

229
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:33,634
I was worried

230
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:37,679
that you had found
a boyfriend or something.

231
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:39,556
I'm so relieved.

232
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:46,396
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:55,781
I put in extra sesame oil,
just how you like it.

234
00:19:12,297 --> 00:19:13,632
It smells good.

235
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:18,887
She's in the bathroom, so go now.

236
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:19,888
Huh?

237
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:23,934
H… Hey… wait…

238
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:25,852
Should we be sneaking around like this?

239
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:28,355
Shouldn't I introduce myself properly?

240
00:19:28,438 --> 00:19:30,274
Are you crazy?

241
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:33,151
Please, leave.

242
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:35,320
What about your birthday?

243
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:38,740
That… I want to spend with you
no matter what.

244
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:40,701
I'll contact you as soon as she leaves.

245
00:19:40,784 --> 00:19:41,785
I promise.

246
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:44,454
She's coming out! Hurry!

247
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:46,039
Shoes, shoes, shoes!

248
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,521
You like this, right?

249
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:13,317
Here, eat the omelet too.

250
00:20:15,068 --> 00:20:16,153
How is school?

251
00:20:18,947 --> 00:20:21,700
Are you enjoying school?

252
00:20:23,577 --> 00:20:27,581
Are you studying like you should be?

253
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:30,542
There's someone in my class
who's really good.

254
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:35,339
And that person is inspiring me.

255
00:20:38,216 --> 00:20:42,804
Sometimes I wonder if I have any talent,
and get a little discouraged, though.

256
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,725
But I just have to do my best!

257
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:54,483
I guess the road to becoming
a creator is a tough one…

258
00:21:18,423 --> 00:21:20,509
Shige? Is something wrong?

259
00:21:20,592 --> 00:21:21,843
So, so, so sorry.

260
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:25,097
I completely forgot that we had
a reservation for a big group.

261
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:28,725
Can I ask you to come in,
just for two hours?

262
00:21:29,393 --> 00:21:31,311
What? Now?

263
00:21:31,395 --> 00:21:32,437
Excuse me.

264
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:33,855
Yes, one moment please.

265
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:39,194
I think I can come in.

266
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:42,197
Really? You're a lifesaver. Hurry, please.

267
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:45,242
Okay.

268
00:22:11,101 --> 00:22:12,269
Noa.

269
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:17,732
- I haven't gotten paid yet, so no.
- Are you serious?

270
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:26,199
What is that? English?

271
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:27,450
Are you traveling?

272
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,121
Not traveling, but…

273
00:22:31,204 --> 00:22:35,250
Vegas would be awesome.
The land of the free.

274
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:40,964
But I'd be happy to go anywhere,
as long as I'm with you.

275
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:48,471
But in order to do that,
we need to win first.

276
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:52,851
Just one, okay?

277
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:53,935
- Really?
- Yes.

278
00:23:00,358 --> 00:23:01,234
Paw.

279
00:23:02,777 --> 00:23:04,112
- Aren't you going to bark?
- Woof!

280
00:23:06,698 --> 00:23:08,825
You're the best girlfriend!

281
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:10,285
All right, all right.

282
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:12,037
- Can I go?
- Sure.

283
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,831
- I will win, I promise.
- Yeah, yeah…

284
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:15,832
Bye!

285
00:23:24,716 --> 00:23:26,885
That was delicious.

286
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:32,349
I'm sorry, Mom.

287
00:23:33,975 --> 00:23:36,478
I'm really happy that you're here,

288
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:40,649
but I still haven't finished my assignment
that's due today…

289
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:42,943
Really?

290
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:47,697
My goodness,
you should've told me that earlier.

291
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:52,494
After I clean this all up,
I'll go back to my hotel.

292
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:54,663
You don't have to worry about me.

293
00:23:54,746 --> 00:23:58,833
You work hard on your assignment! Okay?

294
00:24:09,552 --> 00:24:11,012
I'm so sorry, Mom.

295
00:24:12,555 --> 00:24:14,307
Thank you for waiting.

296
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:16,351
- Here's your karaage.
- Can you take our order?

297
00:24:16,434 --> 00:24:18,603
- Yes.
- The seasonal carpaccio please.

298
00:24:18,687 --> 00:24:20,438
- One carpaccio.
- That's all.

299
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:32,325
Taiga!

300
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:34,828
Can you make that order?

301
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:36,288
Okay.

302
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:38,248
Here's your omelet.

303
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:40,208
RIN

304
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:56,057
Taiga?

305
00:25:02,272 --> 00:25:03,481
Is he mad?

306
00:25:07,694 --> 00:25:10,113
SORRY FOR MAKING YOU WAIT
YOU CAN COME OVER NOW

307
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:12,449
WHERE ARE YOU?

308
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,911
You promised…

309
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:37,307
- Excuse me!
- Yes!

310
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:56,451
LEE YUNGYEOL: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
MIZUKI: RIN - HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

311
00:25:56,534 --> 00:25:57,577
JUNHO: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

312
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,578
LEE HAEUN: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, RIN!
TODAY IS YOUR DAY!

313
00:25:58,661 --> 00:25:59,829
MAMAMON: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MY GIRL!
I'LL LOVE YOU FOREVER!

314
00:25:59,913 --> 00:26:01,206
YUN CHAEWON: IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY! WOW!
WHEN WILL WE HAVE THE PARTY?

315
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:02,832
TAIGA

316
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,417
SORRY FOR MAKING YOU WAIT
YOU CAN COME OVER NOW

317
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:05,794
WHERE ARE YOU?

318
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:08,213
Why?

319
00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:24,145
Unbelievable!

320
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,689
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

321
00:26:26,773 --> 00:26:28,191
Thank you.

322
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:33,655
Finally, they're gone.

323
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:37,033
Thanks so much for today.

324
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:38,576
- You really saved me.
- No worries.

325
00:26:44,457 --> 00:26:45,917
RIN

326
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:48,253
Oh crap!

327
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:55,468
TAIGA

328
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:01,224
TOMORROW - I'LL GO
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING

329
00:27:38,428 --> 00:27:39,804
Happy birthday!

330
00:27:50,982 --> 00:27:52,942
Why didn't you say anything?

331
00:27:53,818 --> 00:27:54,736
What?

332
00:27:56,362 --> 00:27:57,989
I was waiting for you the whole time.

333
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,993
I messaged you as soon as eomma left.
I was looking forward to it!

334
00:28:02,785 --> 00:28:03,870
Sorry.

335
00:28:05,663 --> 00:28:07,415
I noticed around midnight

336
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,084
and called you right away…

337
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:13,713
Why didn't you
check your phone until then?

338
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:16,966
I was busy at work.

339
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,052
What? You said you had the day off.

340
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:20,136
Well…

341
00:28:21,054 --> 00:28:22,931
I was asked to work that evening.

342
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:27,685
Tell me those kinds of things.
Why didn't you say anything?

343
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:29,103
That's because…

344
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,984
I thought you were having fun
with your mom.

345
00:28:39,072 --> 00:28:41,032
I'm sorry about eomma coming…

346
00:28:43,076 --> 00:28:47,747
But I wanted to be with you
when it became my birthday.

347
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,753
When you like someone,
don't you naturally want to talk to them?

348
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:56,673
Not just once a day,
or because you have to.

349
00:28:57,423 --> 00:29:00,260
- You can't even put in that effort for me.
- Wait.

350
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:04,013
I'm sorry for not telling you.

351
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:07,600
- But that has nothing to do with--
- It does!

352
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:10,937
I like to hear from you.

353
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,273
And when you put in the effort,
it makes me happy.

354
00:29:14,607 --> 00:29:15,608
Why don't you get that?

355
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:29,330
All my friends from Korea
contacted me at midnight.

356
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:34,210
That is how important
birthdays are to them.

357
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:39,924
How was I supposed to know…

358
00:29:42,677 --> 00:29:45,013
Don't push your standards on me.

359
00:29:55,148 --> 00:29:57,650
Fine. Whatever.

360
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:57,543
Here's your water.

361
00:30:58,503 --> 00:31:00,254
TANOMI

362
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:01,756
Hello.

363
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,174
Oh, what's wrong?

364
00:31:03,257 --> 00:31:06,511
Plans have changed, so can I work today?

365
00:31:06,594 --> 00:31:07,637
Changed?

366
00:31:08,763 --> 00:31:10,807
I see…

367
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,393
Sorry, that was my fault.

368
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:15,979
No, it's not your fault, Shige.

369
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:20,566
Maybe it is difficult for two people

370
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,319
from different backgrounds to be together?

371
00:31:26,197 --> 00:31:28,908
You two are separate human beings,
so running into problems

372
00:31:28,992 --> 00:31:30,535
is to be expected.

373
00:31:31,494 --> 00:31:34,080
It's not convincing,
coming from a single guy, huh?

374
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:40,169
What do you think was the problem?

375
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:48,136
I can't seem to keep up with her.

376
00:31:49,262 --> 00:31:51,014
She wants to communicate regularly,

377
00:31:51,097 --> 00:31:53,057
but I don't understand that concept.

378
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:57,020
Of course, it can't be helped
that we're from different cultures.

379
00:31:57,103 --> 00:31:59,564
And I thought
that it wouldn't matter, but…

380
00:32:01,482 --> 00:32:04,152
Why did Rin say that she wants
to communicate regularly?

381
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:07,697
She said…

382
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,784
she wants me to know more about her.

383
00:32:15,663 --> 00:32:19,333
Then I don't think it's the lack
of communication that she's mad about.

384
00:32:25,131 --> 00:32:28,134
It's okay to run into problems.

385
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:45,443
Shige.

386
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:48,654
Can I take today off, after all?

387
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:51,616
Sure. Good luck.

388
00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:02,562
Rin.

389
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:04,480
Taiga…

390
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:11,988
Hey, wait!

391
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:14,574
Rin!

392
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:49,775
I'm sorry…

393
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:57,074
I couldn't celebrate
your birthday with you.

394
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:04,415
If I had communicated with you,
this wouldn't have happened.

395
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:33,694
I'm sorry too.

396
00:35:34,904 --> 00:35:36,989
I was only thinking about myself.

397
00:35:38,157 --> 00:35:40,243
I wasn't thinking about your feelings.

398
00:35:49,502 --> 00:35:51,003
Your present…

399
00:35:51,087 --> 00:35:52,255
I loved it.

400
00:35:53,506 --> 00:35:55,424
I barely told you about it…

401
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:57,593
But you remembered?

402
00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:04,183
When you said that you're a big fan,
your eyes were sparkling.

403
00:36:05,393 --> 00:36:07,228
I could tell you really liked it.

404
00:36:08,938 --> 00:36:11,983
You were trying
to get to know me, after all.

405
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:19,991
Lately,

406
00:36:21,325 --> 00:36:22,702
when I'm cooking,

407
00:36:23,786 --> 00:36:25,663
I think of you.

408
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,544
"Will she like this,
if I make this for her?"

409
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:36,841
"What would she say
if I sent a photo of this to her?"

410
00:36:39,844 --> 00:36:41,178
I should have

411
00:36:43,514 --> 00:36:44,849
told you all these things.

412
00:36:47,518 --> 00:36:50,438
We can talk to each other any time.
We're dating, after all.

413
00:37:04,368 --> 00:37:05,328
From now on…

414
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:09,665
I want to know more about

415
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,293
the things you value.

416
00:37:15,796 --> 00:37:16,964
Thank you.

417
00:37:19,508 --> 00:37:20,551
Me too.

418
00:38:33,707 --> 00:38:35,626
Welcome home, Taiga.

419
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:38,045
Don't get the wrong idea.
Anyone can do that.

420
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:41,298
I wasn't able to live up to my
family's expectations.

421
00:38:41,382 --> 00:38:43,050
I don't think so!

422
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:44,009
