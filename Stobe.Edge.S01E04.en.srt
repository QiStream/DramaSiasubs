1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,060
What did you do to Kinoshita?

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,320
I kissed her. Only on the forehead though.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,930
Don't let people like that ruin our friendship.
That's just wrong.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,660
You're such a weirdo, Kinoshita.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,000
Sayuri and Daiki are now officially a couple!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,380
You can't expect anything from Ren
so long as he has a girlfriend.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,720
You don't understand the limits there are
in your relationship with him.

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,430
I'll help you forget Ren, for good.

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,290
So try experiencing romance with me.

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,810
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:42,410
I can't date someone while having these feelings for Ren.

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,190
You can never be more than friends with him though.

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,220
I never expected anything more than that.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,110
Humans are creatures of greed.

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,050
If you truly love him, you'll hope for more.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,570
But with Ren, that sort of next step is impossible.

17
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,950
You'll only learn to feel oppressed by that reality.

18
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,230
Those are the limits I'm talking about.

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,970
- But...
- No need to give me an answer now.

20
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,870
I'm sure you'll face your limits soon enough.

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,250
Come to me when it becomes obvious, yeah?

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,040
I know Ren already has Mayuka.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,580
But there's no limit to liking someone.

24
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,850
Morning.

25
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,620
This one's so cute!

26
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,790
You'd pull it off, Sayu.

27
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,980
- You think?
- Totally.

28
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,820
Uehara, you're on duty today.

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,180
Come grab the notebooks from the teacher's lounge.

30
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,100
But I'm busy right now.

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,950
You are not. Now hurry.

32
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,780
- Be right back.
- See you.

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,570
- These other accessories aren't bad either.
- Yeah.

34
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,570
Which one was Sayuri raving about? Show me!

35
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,020
This one.

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,550
Didn't realize she liked hearts.

37
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,300
Why not get it for her as a Christmas present?

38
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,740
That was the plan.

39
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,430
You might want to take a closer look.

40
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,910
Huh? Forty-two...
[Price: 42,000 Yen]

41
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,470
Too high of a hurdle, huh?

42
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,720
No, I can afford this.

43
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,220
- Barely.
- Seriously?

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,900
Messing around with the Director again?

45
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,440
Ren.

46
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,690
That's still his position, right?

47
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,050
Yup.

48
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,770
He's still a hefty director.

49
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,460
- Could I hold him?
- Go ahead.

50
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,630
Sorry.

51
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,430
I didn't mean to...

52
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,200
Sorry.

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,930
Don't sweat it. That was an accident.

54
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,160
I'm going to grab some more trash bags.

55
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,210
But she pushed me away. That stings.

56
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,180
I think I'm coming to despise you for real this time, Ren.

57
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,700
What the...

58
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,500
My heart is wavering. It hurts.

59
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,600
I feel like I'm choking up.

60
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,670
I don't know what this is.

61
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,410
That'll be 380 yen.

62
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,240
I'm starving.
[Episode 4]

63
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,360
I wonder if they'll still have the Cheese-Pickled Plum Rolls.
[Episode 4]

64
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,450
Is that even on the menu?

65
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,350
It is.

66
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,180
Look, it's Ren.

67
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,160
You don't need to hide.

68
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,760
Sometimes a girl needs to hide from her crush.

69
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,330
You pervert!

70
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,390
What's up, Ninako?

71
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,930
Nothing!

72
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,440
Ren seems off, doesn't he?

73
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,200
38.7 degrees?

74
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,380
Didn't realize it was that bad.

75
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,290
Go lie down and rest.

76
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,850
- Could you help him up?
- Of course.

77
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,710
You okay?

78
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,260
Yeah, I'm fine.

79
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:03,110
You should speak up when you're not feeling well.

80
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,590
Trying to push through never makes it easier.

81
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,030
Head home once you rest up, alright?

82
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,850
- Slap that cooling patch on him.
- Right.

83
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,150
I'll be fine once I lie down for a bit.

84
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,220
I have a part-time shift today anyway.

85
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,340
Are you crazy?

86
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll cover your shift, so get some rest at home.

87
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,560
You don't have to always try so hard, you know?

88
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,370
I guess so.

89
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,350
- See you.
- Thanks again.

90
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,120
- Take care.
- You too.

91
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,180
I'm absolutely beat.

92
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,380
- Thankfully it wasn't a busy day.
- Yeah.

93
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,120
I'm glad it's not just me and Ando.

94
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,190
It's so cold today.

95
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,540
Ando, could I grab that scarf from you?

96
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,190
And leave me to freeze? No can do.

97
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,830
Stingy.

98
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,140
Well, I'm headed this way.

99
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,410
- See you two.
- See you.

100
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,520
Don't let my confession bother you.

101
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,230
As if.

102
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,620
I want it to weigh on your mind.

103
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,460
But not to the point of troubling you.

104
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,230
And since it seems like this is awkward for you,
I'll head home by a different way.

105
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,100
Careful on your way back.

106
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,440
Yeah, thanks.

107
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,650
Here, take this.

108
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,160
What? It's fine, I'll manage.

109
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,600
Besides, didn't you say you'd freeze?

110
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,590
I'm only nice to girls I like.

111
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,160
I'm not kind to just anyone, okay?

112
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,520
See you, for real this time.

113
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,060
Kinoshita.

114
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,320
- Morning.
- Morning.

115
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,560
Thanks for covering my shift the other day.

116
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,210
How are you feeling?

117
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,120
I feel much better.
I practically spent the entire weekend in bed.

118
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,190
Let me cover a shift for you to make up for it.

119
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,690
It's fine. With exam season coming up,
I've only scheduled one shift a week anyway.

120
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,500
Then is there anything else I can do for you?

121
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,890
Sorry, I can't think of anything.
My brain is fried from cramming and sleep deprivation.

122
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,230
Your explanation makes much more sense this week.

123
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,080
I should've expected nothing less from the Math God.

124
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,200
Stop it with that nickname.

125
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,560
Ren, do you like math?

126
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,460
I love it.

127
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,000
Didn't we have this conversation already?

128
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,540
Did we? Sorry, my bad.

129
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,750
Sorry.

130
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,780
Now arriving at Shin-Sakuta.

131
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,210
The doors on the left side will open.

132
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:07,200
"I wonder how she'll react
when I give her my Christmas present?"

133
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,940
So? Did I read your mind?

134
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,180
What? Did not.

135
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,690
Hey guys, thanks for waiting.

136
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,500
- Dad, you're so late.
- Sorry.

137
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,970
[Yohei Korenaga]

138
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,850
- Thank you.
- Your menus.

139
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,220
Much appreciated.

140
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,820
Aren't you busy studying for college entrance exams, Mayuka?

141
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,710
Yeah, but I could make time.

142
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,100
I bet she's more busy with work and romance.

143
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,870
Hey, I find time to study.

144
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,220
Are things going well with your boyfriend?

145
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,740
Yup.

146
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,170
What about you, Dad?
Thinking of getting back together with Mom?

147
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,390
I guess not.

148
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,250
I wanted to talk about something related to that.

149
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,570
Sorry! Was I leaning on you the entire time?

150
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,850
The next stop is Nijinodai.

151
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,950
We passed your stop.

152
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,830
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, I passed out too.

153
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,540
Liar. I know you.

154
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,340
You just felt bad about poking me awake.

155
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,190
- I'm so sorry.
- I was asleep, really.

156
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,900
You don't need to apologize.

157
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,620
Alright, see you tomorrow.

158
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,310
What? I'll wait for your train with you.

159
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,840
It's really the least I could do.

160
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,490
You shouldn't stay out any later than you need to.

161
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,480
- But...
- No buts.

162
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,020
It's already late as it is.

163
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,710
Okay, fine. Then I'll get going.

164
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,670
Yeah. See you.

165
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,560
Ren!

166
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,170
I'd better keep you company while you wait.

167
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,590
Close call.

168
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,990
Why?

169
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,870
Why are you like this?

170
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,850
Sorry, I can't help it.

171
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,960
It's getting late. You really should head home for the day.

172
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,390
Okay.

173
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,670
Humans are creatures of greed.

174
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,070
If you truly love him, you'll hope for more.

175
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,530
You can't expect anything from Ren
so long as he has a girlfriend.

176
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,490
You don't understand the limits there are
in your relationship with him.

177
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,130
You're wrong.

178
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,550
It's not like that.

179
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:58,090
With Ren, that sort of next step is impossible.

180
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,470
I know that already.

- Yeah.

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,170
- See you.
- See you around.

185
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,800
What's up? It's already pretty late today.

186
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,290
Sayuri, I'm sorry.

187
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,420
For what?

188
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,810
My dad's job is transferring him to Fukuoka.

189
00:15:53,550 --> 00:16:00,210
He's moving there with his new wife,
and I'm going with them.

190
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,510
I tried telling him I wanted to stay here
with my sister and our mom.

191
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,840
But I couldn't.

192
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,130
Because my dad, he was smiling.

193
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,180
He looked so sad to leave us.

194
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,960
I couldn't raise any objections.

195
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,620
I decided I would go with him of my own accord.

196
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:43,320
But I don't want to leave you either.

197
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,170
I just don't know anymore...

198
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,180
Maybe we should elope.

199
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,720
Sure.

200
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,870

Let's get a bit closer.

00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,660
Come on!

204
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,210
I only hear the waves.

205

It's like we're alone in the world.

206
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,620
Yeah.

207
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,250
I'll go buy something warm to drink.

208
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,090
Be right back.

209
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,220
Thanks.

210
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,650
You didn't get anything for yourself?

211
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,350
I'll be fine.

212
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,720
Let's share this then.

213
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,620
That hits the spot.

214
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,880
- Here.
- Thanks.

215
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,500
We'll have to start pinching pennies.

216
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,220
We'll drop out, rent a cheap apartment,

217
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,470
and we'll start working.

218
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,680
What sort of job should I start with?

219
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,650
Maybe I should work part-time at a cafe, like Ninako.

220
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,400
Working at a bakery sounds nice, too.

221
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,220
Didn't you say you wanted to become a nail technician?

222
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,790
Yeah.

223
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:15,450
But that requires attending a beauty school,
and getting a license.

It's fine.

225
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,220
I wasn't serious about becoming one anyway.

Yeah.

230

I'll get a part-time job.

231
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,430
I'll save up, so I can visit you often.

I don't want you to have to accommodate me.

They haven't come in today.

246
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,910
I'll try giving them a call.

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,640
What?

248
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,390
I heard about your dad's transfer.

249
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,040
And about what happened with Sayu, too.

250
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,090
I seriously thought for a second
that the two of us could elope.

251
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,220
Damn, I'm such a kid.

252
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,690
And you're fine with this, Daiki?

253
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,210
Don't you love Sayu?

254
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,090
Of course I love her.

255
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,580
That's why I have to do this. For Sayuri.

256
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,540
- Ouch.
- What are you trying to act all mature for?

257
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,220
You aren't thinking about what's best for Sayu at all.

258
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:21,250
Sayu doesn't want you to become "mature" for her sake.

259
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,900
What would you know?

260
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,750
More than you, apparently.

261
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,040
You know what Sayu told me?

262
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,600
She said she loves how honest and devoted you are.

263
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,210
So go be straightforward,
and fumble around like you always do.

264
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,880

I know. Mayuka needs Ren right now.

271
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,080
I guess it's true.

272
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:42,170
No feelings last forever, do they?

273
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,800
Ren.

274
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,420
It's okay.

I won't leave you.

276
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,660
I'll always be here for you.

277
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,840
I have to shut these feelings up inside me.

I'll prove to you some things won't ever change.

Even if I kept piling on reasons to love him,

283
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,820
it would only hurt in the end.

This only happens when I'm with Kinoshita.

It's like I'm me, but I'm not myself.

Nothing wrong with finding a new side to yourself.
