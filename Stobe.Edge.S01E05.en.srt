You shouldn't be out alone at night. It can be dangerous.

I just don't want to settle down there.

I moved there with my mother,

When we enjoyed each other's company.

My parents promised eternal love to each other.

It's Christmas Eve, after all.

165
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,060
- Say, Ninako.
- Yeah?

166
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,040
Do you have a crush?

167
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,650
I do.

168
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,290
It's no one you know though.

169
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,850
- I see.
- Yeah.

170
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,290
- Excuse me.
- One moment.

171
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:01,790
Gacchan, you have a crush on Ninako?

172
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:07,420
No? I was just wondering if she still had a thing for Ren.

173
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:12,010
I like Ren when he's with Ninako.

174
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,860
So you're on his side too?

175
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,960
Of course I am.

176
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,180
I envy you, Gacchan. You seem to have no worries at all.

177
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,790
You're not the first to say that.

178
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,420
No person is without worry though.

179
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,350
I have to work until closing today...

180
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,040
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

181
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,560
Hey there.

182
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,250
Hey.

183
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,180
You've got a tough heart, don't you?

184
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,590
I mean, your crush is probably enjoying
a Christmas date right now.

185
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,520
I'd lose my appetite at the thought.

186
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,440
Unlike you, I'm a sensitive guy at heart.

187
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,850
Don't compare your pathetic stomach to mine.

188
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,520
And what are those boney wrists?
I bet you're even lankier than me.

189
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,620
Oh yeah? There's no way.

190
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,520
Really? Then prove it.

191
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,250
- Ready, and...
- Ready, and...

192
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,080
Dang it, I lost.

193
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm not holding your hand.

194
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:01,040
Remember when you said I'd face my limits soon enough?

195
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,730
I think I'm coming to realize what you were talking about.

196
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,770
Then choose me.

197
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,870
If I was your boyfriend, I would cherish you.

198
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,970
I would treasure you.

199
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,800
I would make you fall for me.

200
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,120
I'm home.

201
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,200
Welcome back.

202
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,830
How was your first ever Christmas date?

203
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,580
Can it. How did your audition go?

204
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,760
It was perfect.

205
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,740
Oh? Guess it was worth choosing your job over Ichinose, huh?

206
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,040
Don't put it like that.

207
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,950
Man, if I were Ichinose, I'd be crying waterfalls about now.

208
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,540
Ren understands how important my job is to me.

209
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,210
He's just trying to be the mature one.

210
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,320
Men like to look good in front of girls.

211
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,730
Don't chalk up your attitude as a universal experience.

212
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,800
Besides, Ren isn't a brat like you.

213
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,320
I'm impressed.

214
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,330
Ichinose manages to act like the mature adult for you, huh?

215
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,300
I'm sorry I had to cancel today.

216
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,840
You don't need to apologize.

217
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:40,030
Where should we go when your exams are over?

218
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,280
Let's visit someplace you've been dying to go to.

219
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,840
Together, of course.

220
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,550
I'll be by your side, okay?

221
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,000
Always.

222
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,620
Thanks.

223
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,590
Talk to you soon.

224
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,200
- I'm going to hop in the car.
- Sure.

225
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,430
Dad, why did you get a divorce with Mom?

226
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,000
If you were only going to part ways,
you shouldn't have married her at all.

227
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,900
I know you may not be convinced,
especially when it's coming from me.

228
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:51,890
But everything I promised your mother back then,
was truly how I felt about her.

229
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,750
Are you that shocked about Dad remarrying?

230
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,700
No. I'm more shocked at how I'm okay with it.

231
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,790
So you've accepted it after all.

232
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:17,140
The same breeze rustles our hair.

233
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,610
Yet something about that...

234
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,640
is endearing to me.

235
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,640
Ren.

236
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,640
Thanks for all you've done for me.

237
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,740
Huh?

238
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:54,250
You'd always cover for my slip ups at the cafe. So, thank you.

239
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,580
It was no big deal, really.

240
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,470
- I forgot something at the cafe, so I need to head back.
- Sure.

241
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:11,020
Have a happy new year.

242
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,390
You too.

243
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,350
I could continue pining for Ren,

244
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,340
and keep piling on reasons to love him.

245
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,380
But it would only hurt in the end.

246
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,310
- Ando.
- Ninako?

247
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,040
Can we talk?

248
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,180
[Season 1 Finale]

249
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,000
I knew nothing about this feeling a year ago.
[Season 1 Finale]

250
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,650
I love you. I really do.

251
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,580
Plenty of things will remain the same though.

252
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,370
Why does it become so complicated when like turns to love?

253
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,940
I want to stay in love with Ren.

254
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,340
[Epilogue]

255
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,300
Ren, don't quit the job. Please?

256
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,830
I told you, I already turned in my final notice.

257
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,420
Then could you at least tell me why you're quitting?

258
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,220
Because the grand opening rush is coming to an end.

259
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,190
Doesn't that suffice for a reason?

260
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,750
I'm asking because I think there's more to it than that.

261
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,130
Don't be stubborn and deny how you really feel.

262
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,510
Manabu.

263
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,960
Am I really acting in the wrong here?

264
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,930
What's so bad about being stubborn?

265
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,630
I told you not to stir the pot, and make his life more confusing.

266
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,420
But Ninako's the one he really...

267
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,050
Which is exactly why he's distancing himself.

268
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,680
He's doing his best to extinguish his feelings for her.

269
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,230
That's the answer he settled on, alright?
