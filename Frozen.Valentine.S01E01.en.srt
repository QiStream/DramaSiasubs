1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,711
Hello, and for today,

2
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:17,786
we’ll be holding auditions in two rounds.

3
00:00:18,154 --> 00:00:20,221
The first round will be introductions,

4
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,741
showing your special talent,

5
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:24,041
and then performing the assigned scene.

6
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:26,057
Those who pass

7
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:29,248
will move on to an acting test with our lead actress.

8
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:34,272
Hello, my name is Pingrak Parin, I'm 19.

9
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:37,000
I’m currently studying Communication Arts.

10
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:39,736
You're passed the first round.

11
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:42,997
This round we'll have…someone acting with you.

12
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:44,066
Okay.

13
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:46,133
You can take a moment to focus and get ready.

14
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,870
That day, I met Charm again.

15
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:43,790
And I knew right away…

16
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:47,424
those feelings never really disappeared.

17
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:52,966
Charm, happy Valentine’s Day.

18
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:54,066
I’m annoyed with you.

19
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,933
No matter where you are,

20
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,166
you’re still my Valentine,the warmest one I’ve ever had.

21
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:51,266
Ouch!

22
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,333
Hey! Be careful.

23
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,700
Can you get up?

24
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,666
Hey…are you hurt anywhere?

25
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:32,156
Uh…

26
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:34,327
Do you want me to take you to the nurse’s office?

27
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,661
Thank you, but… I’m okay.

28
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:38,504
but… I’m okay.

29
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,638
You!...Is this the senior

30
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:03,627
who helped you the other day?

31
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:04,127
Huh,

32
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,706
that look.

33
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:11,306
You’ve got a crush on her already, don’t you?

34
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:14,578
Hey, what are you talking about?

35
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,852
A crush on who?

36
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:18,933
We’re still kids.

37
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:22,818
Oh, okay. If you don’t like her, then you don’t.

38
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,866
But I’m watching you.

39
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:27,566
Cher, stop.

40
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,800
You keep staring at Charm nonstop.

41
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,466
You just stop and stare every time you see her.

42
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,966
Well… she’s really nice, you know.

43
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,966
There are so many people at school,

44
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,082
but I’ve never met anyone

45
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,334
this warm before.

46
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,666
If she were that kind, Are you totally into her already?

47
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,028
It’s not just that she’s pretty

48
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:13,925
and kind.

49
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:19,276
She’s thoughtful, and she’s always helping people.

50
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,166
Your face’s turning red.

51
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,133
Write it down, write it down.

52
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:53,700
Happy Valentine’s Day, everyone.

53
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Charm.

54
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,666
I’m annoyed with you.

55
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:06,266
I don’t like people following me around.

56
00:09:23,704 --> 00:09:24,694
Sorry.

57
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:30,249
I just wanted to give flowers and… chocolate

58
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:31,837
to you for Valentine’s Day, that’s all.

59
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:32,541
I can’t accept it.

60
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:38,616
A nerdy girl with glasses

61
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,580
has nothing special,

62
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,013
and Charm,

63
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:50,315
who’s pretty,

64
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,806
cool,

65
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:54,846
talented,

66
00:10:57,543 --> 00:10:59,462
and incredibly kind.

67
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,966
Wow, you were pretty harsh on her.

68
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:29,002
I just don’t like that,

69
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,913
girls who stick to me like a shadow.

70
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,826
And I don’t want people thinking

71
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:37,374
I’m playing around too.

72
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,169
Who could ever be better than your sweetheart, Mint?

73
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,096
Honestly,

74
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:47,712
you could’ve just taken it to spare her feelings.

75
00:11:47,712 --> 00:11:49,370
And then give it to me to eat.

76
00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:51,872
Look at this, you already accepted so many.

77
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:53,355
And trust me,

78
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:54,766
by this evening,

79
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:56,566
the guys from our neighboring school

80
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,066
will definitely bring you more.

81
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:01,294
I think you should prepare a basket for them

82
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:04,234
Look at all this stuff, You won’t even help me carry them.

83
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,966
Charm, let’s go.

84
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,466
They’re…actually perfect for each other already.

85
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:10,366
Hey, what about the gifts?

86
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,300
Hey girls, could you help me hold this for a second?

87
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,995
Umm…I really need to pee.

88
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:30,052
By the way, do I have something stuck in my teeth?

89
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,182
Sorry…

90
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:39,770
Well…is there something in my teeth?

91
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,166
Charm!

92
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,966
Charm, I’m starting to get possessive of you.

93
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,966
So many people are into you like this.

94
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:06,966
Why would you be possessive?

95
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:10,300
I only look at you, just you

96
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,466
Then… tonight, let’s go watch a movie.

97
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,376
After the movie,

98
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:04,421
come back to my condo.

99
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,876
Ugh…,you always gives me leftovers

100
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:29,900
thinking that I will eat them

101
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,666
But they’re good though.

102
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,733
Of course they’re good.

103
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,133
It’s Belgian chocolate.

104
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,800
I think you should give up on Charm already.

105
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,125
I can’t help it, Cher. I admire her.

106
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:52,368
What am I supposed to do?

107
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:56,571
Personally, I think she doesn’t like flat-chested kids

108
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:58,600
like us, you know.

109
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,400
Cher!

110
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,266
She probably likes sexy types like Mint.

111
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:05,948
Not nerdy girls with glasses like you.

112
00:19:05,948 --> 00:19:08,209
I’m not thinking that far.

113
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:10,332
I just admire her.

114
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:12,455
Just admiration.

115
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:13,858
Yeah.

116
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:14,600
Just admiration.

117
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,130
Yeah.

118
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,466
She said she’s almost home.

119
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,966
I really want to go see Charmie

120
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,200
But…

121
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,100
I’ll get cat hair on my clothes and get yelled by Mom, too

122
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,600
I miss her though.

123
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,100
Next time, okay?

124
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:34,666
See you.

125
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,559
I’m going.

126
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:39,465
Bye

127
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:40,000
Bye-bye.

128
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:08,150
I’m annoyed with you.

129
00:20:09,662 --> 00:20:11,482
I don’t like people following me around.

130
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:15,266
Charm!

131
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,733
I think you should give up on Charm already.

132
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:25,649
I think she doesn’t like flat-chested kids

133
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:26,866
like us, you know

134
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:28,766
I’m almost home, Mint.

135
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:31,566
Okay.

136
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,480
Charm,

137
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:36,286
sweet dreams.

138
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:39,966
Thanks.

139
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,500
Just wait and see.

140
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,700
When I grow up, I’ll be prettier than Charm

141
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,733
and way hotter than Mint.

142
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:22,995
Do I look good?

143
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:23,589
Turn left, turn right

144
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:25,069
beautiful

145
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Thank you ,mother.

146
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,983
I seriously can’t believe this.

147
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,200
You grew up to be this hot.

148
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,466
Look, I can’t even carry all these stuff.

149
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,889
Hey… by the way,

150
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,590
have you talked to your parents yet?

151
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,645
About going to study BBA in the US.

152
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:56,106
Huh…

153
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:59,133
Cher, I don’t really want to go yet.

154
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,666
I’m negotiating with my mom now,

155
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,000
asking to finish my bachelor’s here.

156
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:06,262
Oh,

157
00:23:06,262 --> 00:23:08,266
have you seen this yet?

158
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:09,509
Which one?

159
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:11,400
Hold this for a second.

160
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,000
I’ll show you a photo.

161
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,200
What is it?

162
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,666
You never forgot Charm, did you?

163
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:43,566
Cher.

164
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,100
Say whatever you want.

165
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,966
That was a long time ago.

166
00:23:51,366 --> 00:23:52,400
I have nothing to forget.

167
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,466
I didn’t even get the chance to remember her.

168
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:56,566
Really?

169
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,366
Your eyes don’t say that, Ping.

170
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:06,114
Whatever!

171
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:07,114
Oh!

172
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:08,755
Can we go now?

173
00:24:08,755 --> 00:24:09,400
I’m tired.

174
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,000
Let’s go.

175
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,500
Okay.

176
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,199
This one’s really heavy, what even is this?

177
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,910
How are you?

178
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,071
Tired?

179
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:31,763
I’m okay.

180
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:34,666
Kong.

181
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,266
Hello, P’ Chee.

182
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:37,266
Hello.

183
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:39,066
How was today’s shoot?

184
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:41,333
It was good. She’s easy to work with.

185
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,500
Hello.

186
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,400
Hmm…

187
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:51,533
Your name is Charm, right?

188
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:53,733
Yes.

189
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:55,866
Do you know me?

190
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,600
Of course.

191
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:03,607
I’m about to launch a GL series,

192
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:06,716
and your vibe fits the character perfectly.

193
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:09,537
Would you be interested in auditioning?

194
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,900
Really?

195
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,733
Here’s my card.

196
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:26,300
I hope we’ll get to work together.

197
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:31,466
I’ll get going then.

198
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:32,965
See you all later.

199
00:25:33,537 --> 00:25:34,232
Goodbye, Cheewin.

200
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,944
Bye, you all!

201
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,271
Charmie!

202
00:25:51,006 --> 00:25:52,152
Come here!

203
00:25:53,214 --> 00:25:54,767
Playing hard to get, huh?

204
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,123
Whoa…

205
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,071
Almost a hundred thousand followers.

206
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:23,520
Before now, how come I never

207
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,442
noticed that?

208
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,666
I thought I’d finally forgotten Charm.

209
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,366
But today,

210
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,539
all those memories came rushing back.

211
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:46,238
Stop it, Ping.

212
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,123
It’s just a few photos.

213
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:50,978
Why is my heart beating this fast?

214
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,787
And if fate decides to mess with me…

215
00:26:59,482 --> 00:27:01,664
If I get to meet Charm again…

216
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,065
Should I run away?

217
00:27:06,637 --> 00:27:07,879
Or…

218
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:11,567
let myself fall for her all over again?

219
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:13,333
Ugh!

220
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,533
How’s the casting going?

221
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,733
Whew…submissions keep coming in.

222
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:44,609
But I still haven’t seen chemistry

223
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:45,700
that really wows me.

224
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:47,966
We need to meet them in person to be sure.

225
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,072
I want this series

226
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:53,554
to tell a story about love

227
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:55,116
and equality.

228
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:57,916
It needs to feel beautiful

229
00:27:57,916 --> 00:27:59,385
and honest to the audience.

230
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,400
Alright.

231
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,100
Okay?

232
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,506
As for the content,

233
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:04,133
I expect that

234
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,976
I can show real value

235
00:28:07,976 --> 00:28:10,503
and sincere representation,

236
00:28:10,748 --> 00:28:11,845
not just riding a trend.

237
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,152
Okay, got it.

238
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:15,799
Well, if that’s all…I’ll brief the social team then.

239
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:18,345
Should we set two guiding hashtags?

240
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:20,829
The first one would be #LoveIsLoveStory

241
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,531
And the second one, #GLWithRespect

242
00:28:24,531 --> 00:28:25,031
Perfect.

243
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:25,836
And we also

244
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:27,800
need to appeal to foreign audience

245
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:28,966
as well. Inter fans,

246
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,766
they’re really important.

247
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:31,979
Make it clear, we’re making this GL series

248
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:33,700
with high quality,

249
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,779
We’re not just chasing hype

250
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:37,166
or selling ships.

251
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:38,759
Does that sound good?

252
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:39,566
Sounds great.

253
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:42,700
Once Charm confirms the casting,

254
00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:44,533
PR will be much easier.

255
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,517
And for content like behind-the-scenes

256
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:47,400
or workshops.

257
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,200
We’ll make it crafted,

258
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:50,733
not just selling chemistry.

259
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,866
And when Charm’s deal is finalized,

260
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:54,004
We must really know how

261
00:28:54,004 --> 00:28:55,700
to find the best chemistry match.

262
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:58,106
And should we make short clips too?

263
00:28:58,106 --> 00:28:59,761
So it’s like…to make people

264
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:01,681
understand the emotions conveyed through the series

265
00:29:01,681 --> 00:29:02,630
exactly as we want to convey.

266
00:29:02,998 --> 00:29:04,628
Some people might think we staged everything.

267
00:29:04,628 --> 00:29:06,700
or that we planned it all.

268
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,600
Good thinking, Jen.

269
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,600
Oh, and don’t forget

270
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,500
to inform the university.

271
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:13,675
Well then,

272
00:29:13,675 --> 00:29:15,258
I’ll ask my sister, Preem

273
00:29:15,258 --> 00:29:17,200
to help spread the word on campus.

274
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:19,636
Okay. We’ll make our audience

275
00:29:19,636 --> 00:29:22,755
talked about this GL series everywhere.

276
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:24,766
And let’s aim for awards too.

277
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,466
So exciting.

278
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,666
Thank you, everyone.

279
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,000
Thank you.

280
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:29,866
Thank you.

281
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:31,566
Sure.

282
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,600
Okay, I’ll be waiting for the casting results.

283
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,000
Ping.

284
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,494
Oh, Preem.

285
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:40,366
Hi.

286
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,400
Hi.

287
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,952
So…

288
00:29:42,952 --> 00:29:45,662
my older sister works at J Saffique Studio.

289
00:29:45,662 --> 00:29:46,200
Okay.

290
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,419
She said her studio is currently

291
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:51,200
opening the casting for a new GL series.

292
00:29:51,486 --> 00:29:52,136
Oh.

293
00:29:52,866 --> 00:29:55,993
They asked me to find students from our faculty.

294
00:29:57,178 --> 00:29:58,912
And… I thought of you, Ping.

295
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,326
I wanted to invite you to audition.

296
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:03,031
Would you like to?

297
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:05,500
You thought of me?

298
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,800
Yeah.

299
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,533
Well, it’s an open audition.

300
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,300
No one’s locked in yet.

301
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,943
I also heard

302
00:30:13,943 --> 00:30:16,266
they’re approaching a model

303
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,766
to play the lead role.

304
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,700
Charm.

305
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,200
Do you know her?

306
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,333
I’ll do it.

307
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,500
Great, I’ll send you the details right away.

308
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,000
Okay.

309
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,700
Bye.

310
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,700
Bye.

311
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,600
Cher.

312
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,300
Was that Preem?

313
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:59,666
Do you know what just happened?

314
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:01,500
She invited me to audition for a series.

315
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,629
Paired with Charm.

316
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:03,129
Really?

317
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,166
Then you have to pass.

318
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,900
I really want to know…

319
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,495
if you meet Charm again,

320
00:31:11,108 --> 00:31:12,423
will she remember you?

321
00:31:12,832 --> 00:31:14,375
I want to know too.

322
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,992
If she sees me now,

323
00:31:19,035 --> 00:31:21,057
will she still be as cruel

324
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:22,904
as she was back then?

325
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,666
Cruel, but still lovable, right?

326
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,766
What are you saying?

327
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:27,060
If it were me

328
00:31:27,673 --> 00:31:29,389
who got those treating,

329
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,086
I’d have stopped admiring her a long time ago.

330
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,200
Yes, Pleun?

331
00:32:10,966 --> 00:32:13,400
Oh, Did your Phet just come back?

332
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,266
Okay, I’ll bring Ping with me

333
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,933
Alright, bye.

334
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:24,300
Ping, my dear.

335
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:25,766
Yes?

336
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:28,879
This Sunday, you have to attend the launch of Aunt Pleun’s jewelry brand

337
00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:30,933
with me at our mall

338
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,838
Mom,

339
00:32:34,247 --> 00:32:36,309
do I really have to go?

340
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,484
Of course you do.

341
00:32:37,893 --> 00:32:40,075
This is mandatory.

342
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,094
This event,

343
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:43,400
also holding a diamond fashion show.

344
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:45,200
Sounds fun.

345
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:49,502
When you were kids,

346
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:52,892
you used to play together.

347
00:32:52,892 --> 00:32:53,923
And most importantly, Aunt Pleun’s son

348
00:32:53,923 --> 00:32:55,996
just returned from the US. Do you remember him?

349
00:32:56,323 --> 00:32:58,129
You should talk to him.

350
00:32:58,129 --> 00:33:00,000
So when you go study abroad,

351
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,671
you won’t feel lost.

352
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:04,202
If you need advice,

353
00:33:04,202 --> 00:33:06,161
you can rely on him.

354
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:09,066
Okay, Mom.

355
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,166
Good girl.

356
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:13,733
Girl, you must dress nicely.

357
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:17,000
I’ll have my secretary bringing outfits for you to choose.

358
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:18,966
Okay.

359
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,400
Good job.

360
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,766
Thank you.

361
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,776
My life

362
00:36:19,348 --> 00:36:21,778
feels like it’s already been planned out for me.

363
00:36:23,004 --> 00:36:26,218
But sometimes, the path that looks perfect

364
00:36:27,362 --> 00:36:29,470
isn’t the one I want to take.

365
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,199
I don’t know if it’s fate…

366
00:36:35,975 --> 00:36:37,387
or just a game for my heart

367
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:43,267
But that day was the day I saw you again.

368
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:12,969
Hello everyone.

369
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:14,450
Welcome,

370
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:16,136
and thank you for coming

371
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:17,698
to today’s audition.

372
00:37:17,698 --> 00:37:18,198
For today,

373
00:37:18,198 --> 00:37:20,709
we’ll be holding auditions in two rounds.

374
00:37:20,954 --> 00:37:22,925
The first round will be introductions,

375
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:24,283
showing your special talent,

376
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,703
and performing the assigned scene.

377
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:28,418
Those who pass

378
00:37:28,418 --> 00:37:31,063
will move on to an acting test with our lead actress.

379
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,748
Number 009, please.

380
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:38,178
Hello, my name is Pingrak Parin, I’m 19.

381
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:41,761
I’m studying Communication Arts.

382
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,000
What’s your special talent?

383
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:45,466
I can sing.

384
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,500
Go ahead.

385
00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:10,600
Thank you.

386
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:18,266
Okay, let’s try the scene.

387
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,600
Okay.

388
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,224
I want you to imagine

389
00:38:23,224 --> 00:38:26,200
confessing your feelings to someone,

390
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,566
but then got refused.

391
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,700
Hey,

392
00:39:09,966 --> 00:39:11,100
I like you.

393
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,666
I can’t accept this.

394
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,200
It’s okay.

395
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:40,866
I understand.

396
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,100
Thank you,

397
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:59,500
for at least giving me the chance to say it.

398
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,000
Okay.

399
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:22,133
You passed the first round.

400
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:24,766
I passed?

401
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,533
We’ll see you in the next round.

402
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:28,333
You did great.

403
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,500
Thank you.

404
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,066
Thank you.

405
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:30,866
Thank you.

406
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:36,237
This round, I want to see a love confession

407
00:40:36,237 --> 00:40:37,654
right before a kiss.

408
00:40:37,654 --> 00:40:40,456
We’ll follow safety protocols.

409
00:40:40,456 --> 00:40:43,702
We’ll start with holding hands,

410
00:40:43,866 --> 00:40:45,019
touching the cheek,

411
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:46,336
and tilt in.

412
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,415
When you tilt in, keep the distance within 10 centimeters.

413
00:40:49,415 --> 00:40:53,409
If the lips get too close,

414
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,231
I recommend using a finger like this

415
00:40:56,011 --> 00:40:57,340
instead of an actual kiss.

416
00:40:58,035 --> 00:40:58,760
Are we alright?

417
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,587
Yes.

418
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,500
Okay.

419
00:41:00,966 --> 00:41:03,366
This round we'll have…someone acting with you.

420
00:41:04,733 --> 00:41:05,533
Okay.

421
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:07,019
Well then,

422
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:08,666
Stay focus as getting ready

423
00:42:20,566 --> 00:42:21,666
Pam…

424
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:25,533
I love you.

425
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,766
I’ve loved you for a long time.

426
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:39,133
Pam,

427
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,966
Do you feel the same…even a little?

428
00:44:01,366 --> 00:44:02,166
That was amazing.

429
00:44:02,533 --> 00:44:03,666
Really amazing.

430
00:44:47,766 --> 00:44:51,466
Hello everyone, we’re the cast of Frozen Valentine.

431
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,200
So…how was it? Did she remember you?

432
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:56,000
Not even a little.

433
00:44:56,533 --> 00:44:59,166
Wan, you really take such good care of Charm,

434
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,100
I wish I had a manager like that.

435
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,466
Charm’s acting is seriously so good.

436
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:05,400
The director asked me to tell you

437
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:07,066
that you need to relax a bit more.

438
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:10,200
Looks like we’ll need to add a few more workshop sessions.

439
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,933
No wonder my heart’s beating this fast.
