1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,560
My heart can't help but insist I love Ren.

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,270
I wouldn't want to pull those two apart.

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,520
Everyone's so obsessed with Ren these days, aren't they?

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,950
I like you, Takumi.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,120
Kinoshita, I like you.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,550
Even if there's someone else you like, I want you to choose me.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,080
Please don't give up on Ninako.

8
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,910
[Finale]

9
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,180
You're not even a bit charmed.

10
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,700
Sorry.

11
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,390
Morning.

12
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,380
Morning.

13
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,670
What? You were with Takumi yesterday?

14
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,820
Yeah. He seemed seriously down in the dumps.

15
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,550
Sounds like he'll be skipping school for a while, too.

16
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,220
Really?

17
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,850
You're early.

18
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,190
Could you scram?

19
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,630
I'm supposed to be meeting up with a girl.

20
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,140
She won't be coming.

21
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,450
Huh?

22
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,780
I asked if I could take her place.

23
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,250
What?

24
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,260
Didn't things work out for you and Kinoshita?

25
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,130
I was rejected. For good, this time.

26
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,710
What about you?

27
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,360
You confessed, so aren't the feelings mutual?

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,220
She's been avoiding me the entire day.

29
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,000
Why?

30
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,540
Probably because I'm not the one for her.

31
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,360
So you're just gonna give up?

32
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,900
Are you?

33
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,850
Yeah, I don't care anymore.

34
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,980
I'll just go mess around with some other girls.

35
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,130
Besides, acting earnest and devoted isn't my style.

36
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,300
You know that's not true.

37
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,480
Huh?

38
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,410
You act all composed, while blazing ahead of me.

39
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:58,930
And I watch over your desperate efforts from behind.

40
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,430
That's where I belong.

41
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,730
I knew, since the moment you first spoke to me.

42
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,570
My place...

43
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,970
was right at your back.

44
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,410
You're not acting like the Ando I look up to.

45
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,410
So put on that confident swagger when you're around me.

46
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,950
Damn it.

47
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,590
Excuse me.

48
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,280
I'm sorry for running my mouth the other day.

49
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,620
I was only trying to get in your way.

50
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:39,220
I didn't want you getting any closer to Ichinose.

51
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,540
Okay.

52
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,410
Let's put that behind us then.

53
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,840
You still like him, don't you?

54
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,940
Will you tell him how you feel?

55
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,250
No.

56
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,370
Ren and Ando's friendship was torn apart in the past.

57
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,410
And I don't want to make it any worse.

58
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,230
I didn't realize you were so self-centered, Ninako.

59
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,770
I came to grab something I forgot...

60
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,260
Why were you sitting at my desk?

61
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,560
Wasn't I rejected?

62
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,700
I'm not letting you go until I get an answer.

63
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,670
No! I have a lot on my mind right now!

64
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,720
I wasn't trying to corner you.

65
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:19,480
No, that's not it. I was getting desperate.

66
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,110
I wanted to see if my confession made you waver.

67
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,330
Sorry.

68
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:12,720
I made Ren apologize, when it wasn't even his fault.

69
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,300
Why can't I give him an answer?

70
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,490
What am I so afraid of?

71
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,430
There you are.

72
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,810
I heard Mao told you all about my past with Ren.

73
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,830
Do you pity me, for losing to Ren twice?

74
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,900
No...

75
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,160
Then are you trying to protect my friendship with Ren?

76
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,790
I never asked you to do that.

77
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,130
You're only doing this for yourself.

78
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,520
You feel like you're helping by holding yourself back.

79
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,060
Why do you look so miffed? I'm on the mark, aren't I?

80
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,520
I didn't realize your feelings for Ren were so shallow, Ninako.

81
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,720
Don't worry, I'll get along peachy with Ren.

82
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,800
So why not choose me instead?

83
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,220
You're doing this on purpose.

84
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,210
You're making yourself the bad guy.

85
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,490
You're giving me an excuse to go see Ren.

86
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,180
You're right. I was doing this for myself.

87
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:08,160
I didn't want to be the person who broke you two apart.

88
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,890
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

89
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,040
I'm sorry for making you act like this.

90
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,950
I won't lie to the people who matter to me anymore.

91
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,170
- I... I like...
- Say that to his face.

92
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,830
Not to me.

93
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,410
Go.

94
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,850
Sprint, and you might just catch up to him.

95
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,160
She never even turned to look back.

96
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,090
What a nice guy.

97
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,810
Shut up.

98
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,700
Now it's my turn to go on the offensive.

99
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,160
Get ready, because I'm coming after you with all my might.

100
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,630
I won't be swayed so easily. Not anymore.

101
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,790
I don't mind.

102
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,050
That just means I get to prove how serious I am.

103
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,470
I pushed him away once before.

104
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,920
I was only ever protecting myself.

105
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,010
Run!

106
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,460
Faster, so you can catch up to Ren!

107
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,800
Ren, I like you.

108
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,500
I already have a girlfriend.

109
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,230
Will you continue to be my friend regardless?

110
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,000
So you're quitting the part-time job?

111
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,350
I'm trying to make more time for Mayuka now.

112
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,520
Mayuka needs you right now, Ren.

113
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,100
Remember when you said
I'd face my limits soon enough?

114
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,760
I think I'm coming to realize
what you were talking about.

115
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,560
I thought your feelings would only trouble him.

116
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,100
Ren and Ando treasure whatever bond they share.

117
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,620
I can't stand to destroy it again.

118
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,980
It bothers me when you're not feeling well.

119
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,030
I don't like Ren anymore.

120
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,230
I want to help you, in any way I can.

121
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,940
I like you.

122
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,740
I took plenty of detours to get here.

123
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,150
I made just as many mistakes, too.

124
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,240
But if there's one thing that hasn't changed...

125
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,440
It's how I feel about him.

126
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,120
I want to spill my heart out to you, right now.

127
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,870
- Ren!
- Kinoshita.

128
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,050
I love him.

129
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,670
Ren!

130
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:07,230
And I don't want him to just know it.

131
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,010
- Kinoshita, I...
- Ren.

132
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,150
There's something I want to tell you.

133
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,220
I won't avoid the matter any more.

134
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,260
When you confessed to me,

135
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,220
I was so happy, I thought I was dreaming.

136
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:41,210
But I couldn't give you an answer immediately.

137
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:50,010
Because I was only trying to protect myself.

138
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,880
So...

139
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,250
It's okay.

140
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,220
Take your time, I'm listening.

141
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,440
I was always trying hard, in all the wrong ways.

142
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:29,200
I said I had a lot on my mind, but that's not true at all.

143
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,350
I only have one thing on my mind.

144
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,210
Ren, I like you.

145
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,780
I like you.

146
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,590
I want to be your number one.

147
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,180
I want to call and text you just to chat.

148
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,600
I want to share cakes with you at a cafe.

149
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,840
And when I eat a bit too much, you'd laugh and forgive me.

150
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,890
I want us to hold hands like it's second nature, and...

151
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,410
I like you too, Kinoshita.

152
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,640
I love you.

153
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,050
I love you, too.

154
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,730
I love you too, Ren.

155
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,780
Congrats, Ninako!

156
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,990
Thanks, you two!

157
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,110
So, who confessed first?

158
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,280
- Well...
- Come on, tell us.

159
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,890
- That's a secret.
- Aw!

160
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,620
Ando.

161
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,000
Ando.

162
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,850
- Ando.
- Don't talk to me.

163
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,520
I'm not in the mood to chat with you right now.

164
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:59,790
Give me time to activate my pride, stupid Ren.

165
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,450
- Ando.
- I told you -

166
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,450
That attitude of yours has always been my saving grace.

167
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,410
Like I care, idiot.

168
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,700
Hey, Takumi.

169
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,510
Wanna come over today?

170
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,280
Sorry, but I'm quitting that lifestyle.

171
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,850
I've gotta stay confident for a certain someone, you know?

172
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,090
Ritsuko!

173
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,110
I can't believe you seriously came to visit.

174
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,670
I came to recharge my Ritsuko batteries.

175
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,300
- Gross.
- Huh?

176
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,350
Don't act like my boyfriend after one kiss.

177
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,120
Aw, man...

178
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,150
Wait up, Ritsuko!

179
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,470
[Ritsuko LOVE!]

180
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,670
For real?

181
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,870
So, when's the wedding?

182
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,310
Not funny, Dad.

183
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,800
Right after we graduate.

184
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,950
Someone's a bit too happy.

185
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,790
- Am not.
- No need to be embarrassed.

186
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:30,590
I currently have no interest in romance.
Work is far too much fun!

187
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,470
Mayuka is practically dating her job.

188
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,570
But I do hope to fall in love again one day.

189
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,510
Here you go, Mr. Moriya.

190
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,090
- Kyoichi!
- Long time no see, sir.

191
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,870
How was the cheer squad this year?

192
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:55,310
I worked with a team
that grew as people during our time together.

193
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,490
Sir!

194
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,090
Yes, sir!

195
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:08,010
Excuse me. Could I get one iced latte, and a Takumi to go?

196
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,850
Love makes your chest squeeze.

197
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,940
It makes your heart ache.

198
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,660
It makes you feel tearful for no reason.

199
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,500
It makes you feel like something is stabbing through your heart.

200
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,980
Huh?

201
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,700
What do you mean, "huh"?

202
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,930
You wanted to hold hands like it was second nature.

203
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,010
I know I'm the one who said it, but my heart still skipped a beat.

204
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,910
Ren, does your throat squeeze when you're nervous, too?

205
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,090
I feel more of a tightness around my collarbones.

206
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:06,840
Interesting. So that's how it feels for guys.

207
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,510
Smells like a summer night.

208
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,350
Why did you laugh?

209
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,870
I wasn't laughing.

210
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,330
Don't lie, I saw you smirk.

211
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,750
Then let's say it was for no reason.

212
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,850
There's another one.

213
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,130
Another reason to love him.

214
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,330
[Epilogue]

215
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,700
Aw, man.

216
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,790
I don't want today to end.

217
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,850
Neither do I.
