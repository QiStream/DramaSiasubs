1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,650
I already have my answer.

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,160
I'm not second-guessing myself.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,560
I think I'm coming to realize what limits you were talking about.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,600
Then choose me.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,680
Ichinose manages to act like the mature adult for you, huh?

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,270
I'll prove to you some things won't ever change.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,980
I could continue pining for Ren,

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,650
and keep piling on reasons to love him.

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,410
But it would only hurt in the end.

10
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,840
Thanks for all you've done for me.

11
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,050
Hello?

12
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,840
Mayuka.

13
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,220
What's up?

14
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,850
They repainted the walls of my old apartment.

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,670
This bench has changed, too.

16
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,670
Plenty of things will remain the same though.

17
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,650
Ren, I'm going to say something that sounds crazy, okay?

18
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,180
I don't feel so bothered about my dad remarrying anymore.

19
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,010
So I'm okay now.

20
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,730
What are you leading up to?

21
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,640
Are we breaking up?

22
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,220
Bingo.

23
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,640
I don't get it.

24
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,830
Why?

25
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,370
You know...

26
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,220
I always thought you'd leave me behind one day.

27
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,250
I thought I needed to pick up something for myself

28
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,470
so I could stay at your side.

29
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,460
That's why I began modeling.

30
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,840
And yet, now this job has become really important to me.

31
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,330
A job I might prioritize over you.

32
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,220
Is that your reason?

33
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,260
- In that case -
- Besides...

34
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,710
If we accept the changes I go through,

35
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,580
then we have to accept your changes, too.

36
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,760
Ren.

37
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,170
I know there's already someone else in your heart.

38
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,990
Don't force yourself to forget and move on.

39
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,040
What do you mean, "force myself"?

40
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,040
Am I wrong for putting in the necessary effort

41
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,610
to keep our relationship thriving?

42
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:35,670
You were putting in an effort to keep your promise to me.

43
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,000
It wasn't for the sake of our relationship.

44
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,160
You'll always feel obligated in one way or another
if you stay with me.

45
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,250
That's just how it is.

46
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,430
- I don't -
- It'd only hurt me to see you like that, Ren.

47
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,890
If your feelings for me weren't ever a lie,
then I can't ask for anything more.

48
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,950
I've chosen to accept my changes.

49
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,950
You need to accept yours, too.

50
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,480
No feelings last forever, do they?

51
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,820
It's okay.

52
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,050
I'll always be here for you.

53
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,050
Always.

54
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,250
I'll be okay.

55
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,590
And I'm sure you will be, too.

56
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,710
Ren.

57
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,070
Bye-bye.

58
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:47,310
You're probably right, Ando. Pining for Ren will only hurt.

59
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,560
But I don't want to deny my feelings.

60
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,690
I want to stay in love with Ren.

61
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:14,440
I can't go out with you, while having feelings for someone else.

62
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,470
Ninako.

63
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,220
I love you.

64
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,220
I love you, even when you're rejecting me.

65
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,000
I really, really love you.

66
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,420
Remember when you said I'd get it
when I had a crush like yours?

67
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,210
Well, this is that crush.

68
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:53,210
So it doesn't look like I'll be able to move on any time soon.

69
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,850
Welcome home.

70
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,550
What happened?

71
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,080
I went and made the mature choice.

72
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:31,990
Guess I'll be seeing more honest smiles from you, huh?

73
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,190
Yeah, I think you will.

74
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:42,660
And the fact that I've come to terms with it,
means I've out-matured him.

75
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,600
Here, your make up is smearing.

76
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,220
There, there.

77
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:57,180
I wanted to grow up into adults with him.

78
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,260
- Daiki.
- Yeah?

79
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:10,590
Make sure you grow up with your girlfriend, okay?

80
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,980
Yeah, we will.

81
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,700
Alright, worry about yourself first, Sis.

82
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,660
There, there. You did great.

83
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,310
Liking someone is such a simple emotion.

84
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:51,040
Why does it become so complicated when that turns to love?

85
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,890
What?

86
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,990
They broke up? Why?

87
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,540
Daiki didn't know the exact reason either.
[Finale]

88
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,210
Ninako. This is your chance.

89
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,110
I don't think now is the time.

90
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,760
Ren is probably hurting a lot right now.

91
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,230
I wouldn't want to burden him with my feelings
when he's going through a rough spot.

92
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,040
I see.

93
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,810
Happy new year, Director!

94
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,460
- How's it going?
- Sorry to call you out here like this, Ren.

95
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,540
What did you need from me?

96
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,230
To tell you the truth, I like you.

97
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,100
Will you please go out with me?

98
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,830
I'm sorry.

99
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:28,600
Dating is the last thing on my mind right now.

100
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:37,310
No matter why they broke up, they were special to each other.

101
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,240
There's no way he's taking this okay.

102
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,930
Director?

103
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,400
You there, Director?

104
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,200
Caught you.

105
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,150
Sorry I spooked you.

106
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,030
Yeah, you sure did.

107
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,750
Hey, so...

108
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,120
I promise I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, okay?

109
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,040
I know.

110
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,880
See you around.

111
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,230
Yeah, see you.

112
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,470
Ninako, are you giving anyone chocolates for Valentine's Day?

113
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,690
Nope. No chocolates for friends, or crushes this year.

114
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,550
Really?

115
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,020
Aw, too bad.

116
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,810
How do you think I can get Ninako to crush on Ren again?

117
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,460
Beats me.

118
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,950
It really doesn't seem like she'll confess any time soon.

119
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,940
She's not even giving out chocolates for Valentine's this year.

120
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,870
But I think -

121
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,910
Ninako said that? Word for word?

122
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,250
Yeah.

123
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,830
Were you expecting to get something from her as a friend?

124
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,920
I was, yeah.

125
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,230
Hotshot.

126
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,160
I'm heading back out.

127
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,390
Sure, meet you there.

128
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,450
Score.

129
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,260
Ninako!

130
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,530
Happy Valentine's Day.

131
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,450
- What's this?
- Chocolate, obviously.

132
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,020
There's no rule saying guys can't give out chocolates, right?

133
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,830
Sorry, I can't accept this one.

134
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,740
I knew you'd say that.

135
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,060
That's why I prepared another version for you.

136
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,000
Chocolates for a friend, from a friend.

137
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,760
That's acceptable, right?

138
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,220
They're exactly the same.

139
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,770
Are you sure this is "for a friend"?

140
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,260
Duh, of course.

141
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,900
In return, I'll accept any candy "from a friend" for White Day.

142
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,200
Toodles.

143
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,640
What's the difference between chocolate for friends,
and for a crush?

144
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,160
Ninako!

145
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,890
- Morning!
- Morning.

146
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,260
- Say.
- Yeah?

147
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,510
Did you bring any chocolate today?

148
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,080
Specifically, for Ren.

149
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,270
Nope.

150
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,000
Aw, why not? Just give him something "as friends".

151
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,750
I didn't bring anything to give.

152
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,390
Liar, you always have snacks on you.

153
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,870
See?

154
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:12,860
I can say it's "from a friend",
but it'd really mean something more.

155
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,580
That's why I can't give him anything. At least, not this year.

156
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,830
Take your time, and he might find another girl, you know?

157
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,190
Exactly.

158
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,660
I forgot my English textbook.

159
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,690
Either of you got some chocolate to spare?

160
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,480
- Anyone?
- Gacchan.

161
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,010
Could I borrow your English textbook?

162
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,210
Sure, give me a second.

163
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,160
I forgot I brought mine home yesterday.

164
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,630
Ren.

165
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,010
Could Ninako borrow your English textbook?

166
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,800
