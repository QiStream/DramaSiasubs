1
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,934
Huh? What are you doing here?

2
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,978
Why aren't you in your own room?

3
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,941
I'm practicing my swimming.

4
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,902
No, I meant diving.

5
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:12,238
Okay, you keep doing that, Ja-in.

6
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,450
'Cause there's a swimming pool outside.

7
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,452
Mom, let's go swimming.

8
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,371
- Come on, Mom.
- Why do you always want to go swimming?

9
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,083
And I told you not to wear those at home.

10
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,126
They'll make your face ugly.

11
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,088
Outside, not here.

12
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,964
There's a real swimming pool.

13
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,883
Come on, let's go.

14
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:36,679
Just skip work today. Please?

15
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,641
Get up. You need to go to kindergarten.

16
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,560
Just one more dive.

17
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,230
Dive with me, Mom, please?

18
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,691
You do it. Mom will count.

19
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,235
Count to 30.

20
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,490
All right. One,

21
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,450
two,

22
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,702
three,

23
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:01,996
four,

24
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,332
five,

25
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,751
six,

26
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,504
seven...

27
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,845
Shin Ja-in. You can't breathe
while you're diving.

28
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,181
I didn't. I was holding my breath
the whole time.

29
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,724
Keep counting. Hurry.

30
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,061
Eight,

31
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,813
nine...

32
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,946
What was that?

33
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:02,390
Shin Ja-in, you need to take your meds
after breakfast. Don't forget.

34
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,850
Mom might not remember.

35
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,561
Mom. You know that thing you use for work?

36
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,354
Can I draw on it?

37
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,941
Why do you keep drawing on that?
You have lots of sketchbooks.

38
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,486
'Cause if I draw in my sketchbook,
you don't look at it.

39
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,031
What do you mean? Of course I do.

40
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,664
It's on the bed. Go get it.

41
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,170
- Mom!
- Yeah.

42
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,757
The password thing isn't working.

43
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,966
Not again--

44
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,303
Ja-in!

45
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,682
- What will you do about the rain?
- What can I do?

46
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,768
I'll have to take the day off.

47
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,312
Is it raining over there as well?

48
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,939
Yeah, it's pouring down.

49
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,608
- Ah, check the freezer.
- Grandma! Miss you!

50
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,360
- Ja-in, move.
- I left some beef.

51
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,486
- Come over!
- Ja-in--

52
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,113
Use that and the miyeok I left you
to make soup.

53
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,201
I didn't even know it was there.

54
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,410
Miyeokguk sounds good.

55
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,537
Add some water
when you stir-fry the miyeok.

56
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,999
Stop eating junk
and eat some proper meals, okay?

57
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,670
You might be fine now,
but you'll feel it when you're older.

58
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,587
Mom.

59
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,382
I get it. I'm making breakfast.

60
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,134
I'll bring you side dishes
and soup ingredients next week.

61
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,178
Don't skip meals, okay?

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,555
You eat so poorly. I should move in...

63
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,848
Mom, okay.

64
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,060
I'm getting another call.
Talk to you later.

65
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,979
All right. Ah, wait. An-na--

66
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,167
Shin Ja-in. Did you leave the tap on
in the bathroom?

67
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,962
No, I didn't go to the bathroom. Why?

68
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,883
- Never mind.
- Mom, look at what I just drew.

69
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,052
What is it?

70
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,804
Mom and me.

71
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,100
Ja-in.

72
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,521
If you're going to draw Mom,
can't you make me look pretty?

73
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,564
How?

74
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,942
Look, here's red, and here's green.

75
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,861
Don't just use black-- Ah, that's cold.

76
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,320
Mom, this place really is a swimming pool!

77
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,405
- This is the management office.
- Pool!

78
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,698
- Ja-in, shush.
- Pool!

79
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,867
Due to record-breaking rainfall,

80
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,496
floodwaters have reached
the second floor of buildings 101 to 107

81
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,626
and the third floor
of buildings 108 to 110.

82
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,128
- Residents affected...
- Swim, Mom!

83
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,547
- We can swim at home!
- Ja-in, just a second.

84
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,926
- Why not?
- ...evacuate to the upper floors.

85
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,761
You said you'd play with--

86
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,055
Shin Ja-in! I told you to be quiet!

87
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:34,060
Elevators are out of service
and cannot be used to evacuate.

88
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,978
You said we'd go swimming!

89
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,523
- Once again...
- Why won't you do as you're told?

90
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:42,860
- Due to record-breaking rainfall...
- And I told you not to wear this at home!

91
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,279
Stay right here
or you're not getting these back!

92
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:49,117
...and the third floor
of buildings 108 to 110.

93
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,119
Residents affected...

94
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,258
Hello?

95
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,261
Is this Dr. Gu An-na
from Emotion Engine Dev Team 3?

96
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,054
I'm Son Hee-jo from Security Team 1.

97
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,098
- Is your unit flooded?
- Yes.

98
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,560
I'm almost at the apartment
to pick you up.

99
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,855
- Me?
- The third floor will flood soon.

100
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,815
Evacuate upward as soon as you can.

101
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:24,068
If you're packing, just leave it.
Don't be scared.

102
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,320
Climb the stairs with Ja-in. I'll find--

103
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,072
Hello?

104
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,699
Hello?

105
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,636
SHIN JA-IN (JULY, WEEK 2)

106
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,723
Ja-in!

107
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,143
Ja-in!

108
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,605
We need to leave now. Come out!

109
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,238
Ja-in, let's go!

110
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,573
We need to go now.

111
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,327
Ja-in, Mom's sorry.
I was just overwhelmed earlier.

112
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,244
Mom's not mad.

113
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,538
Should Mom give you a piggyback?

114
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,017
Hurry up, honey!

115
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,438
Gyu-na, don't cry. We have to hurry.

116
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,607
- Hi.
- Hi.

117
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,110
Excuse me, can we get past?

118
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,821
You can't carry all that
and look after the kids!

119
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,573
Let's go.

120
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,124
Excuse me.

121
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,089
Excuse me.

122
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,682
Excuse me. Why can't we go up?

123
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,599
Sorry?

124
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,560
I don't know.

125
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,479
Something's blocking the way up there.

126
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,189
I heard someone collapsed.

127
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,653
Excuse me. Can I get through?

128
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,240
Lord, have mercy on us. Deliver us from...

129
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,872
Hurry!

130
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,960
Honey, be careful! You'll fall over.

131
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:01,309
PRESENT DAY, SEOUL

132
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,760
Ja-in, are you scared?

133
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,137
I thought it was just water,

134
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,890
but I don't think
it's water I can swim in.

135
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,144
Do you want to sing with Mom as we go up?

136
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,939
Since we were going to play together
today regardless.

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,441
All day long.

138
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,109
"Regardless"?

139
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,196
What does "regardless" mean?

140
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,657
"Regardless" means--

141
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,158
Mom, look!

142
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,536
- Help!
- Somebody help!

143
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,330
Please!

144
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,001
Help!

145
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:17,885
Along the Milky Way in the blue sky

146
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,848
A little white boat drifting by

147
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,938
With a single laurel tree

148
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,360
There sits one tiny hare

149
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:39,657
No mast upon the boat

150
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,120
No paddle to keep it afloat

151
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:49,375
Yet still it drifts on

152
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,377
Huh?

153
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:57,842
Ja-in.

154
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,969
Stay here, okay?

155
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,138
Where are you going?

156
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,391
I'm not going anywhere.
Just taking a quick look.

157
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,665
We're from 407.

158
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,959
Could we please use your bathroom?

159
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,797
- My children need to go. Please let us in!
- Anyone home?

160
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,383
We just need some water
to mix baby formula!

161
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,135
Make way, please.

162
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,638
If you need the bathroom
or some water, please come in.

163
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,348
- Thank you.
- Yes, come in.

164
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,767
- Thank you.
- Slowly, please.

165
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,226
- Dr. Gu An-na!
- Yes, this way.

166
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,436
Are you here, Dr. Gu?

167
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,021
Dr. Gu An-na!

168
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,231
Here!

169
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,275
I'm here!

170
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,573
Ja-in, let's go.

171
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,826
Ja-in.

172
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,626
Excuse me.

173
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,462
Ja-in.

174
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:18,756
Excuse me.

175
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,758
Sorry.

176
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,384
Shin Ja-in!

177
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,448
An-na, are you okay?

178
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,429
- Ja-in!
- Pass me the kid!

179
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,893
He's not breathing.

180
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,069
Ja-in.

181
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,074
Mom!

182
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,083
You must've been so scared.

183
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,128
It's okay.

184
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,967
Thank you so much.

185
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,303
I'm Son Hee-jo. We spoke earlier.

186
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,263
I just need to film this.

187
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,018
July 7th, 7:55 a.m.

188
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,605
I've confirmed the survival
of Lead Researcher Gu and Shin Ja-in.

189
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,065
We're moving out now.

190
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,901
It's done. Let's go.

191
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,486
Come on.

192
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,239
- Mom!
- I'll carry him.

193
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,783
Let me carry him.

194
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,286
- Will you be okay on the stairs?
- I'll be fine.

195
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,166
Here, get on.

196
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,009
Ja-in, are you okay? Done crying?

197
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,974
I thought you left me
and went into that apartment.

198
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,769
Where would I go without you?

199
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,064
Then so much water came in,

200
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:31,360
and I was scared, and I thought
about what happened ages ago.

201
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,363
Mom, you know.

202
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:40,077
Back when our car fell in the water, Dad--

203
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,994
Ja-in.

204
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,664
Shall we sing like we did earlier?

205
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,207
No.

206
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:50,170
I'm not in the mood for singing right now.

207
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,798
All right. Get some rest, then.

208
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:56,343
We're going to the rooftop.
The company chopper's on its way.

209
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,222
- Is it your first time in a helicopter?
- I noticed the water's salty.

210
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,723
This isn't normal rain, is it?

211
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,643
Three hours ago,
an asteroid hit Antarctica.

212
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,855
All the melted ice is coming north
along with the seawater.

213
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,940
Half of Japan is underwater,

214
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,651
and at this rate,
this 30-story building isn't far behind.

215
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,194
An asteroid collision?

216
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,947
How could they not see this coming?

217
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,033
They did. They just kept quiet
because it couldn't be prevented.

218
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,369
The human race as we know it
will end today.

219
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,875
Wait, hold on.

220
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,047
Are all human beings going to die?

221
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:43,223
You thought your workplace was
just an AI development lab, didn't you?

222
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,558
Nope.

223
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,644
They say it's your job
to create the new human race.

224
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,523
What? How can I--

225
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,609
There are only two people in the world

226
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,028
who worked on the Emotion Engine
that's used for AI.

227
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,405
Our first choice went missing
early this morning.

228
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,867
That's right, your boss,
Chief Researcher Im Hyeon-mo.

229
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,453
She was swept away
with the child she was raising.

230
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,455
We've concluded that she's dead.

231
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,123
You're number two.

232
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,502
When you get to the temporary shelter,
you'll receive your mission.

233
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,048
Just a second. Wait--

234
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,758
Walk while you talk.

235
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,969
I don't really know that much.

236
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,932
The Emotion Engine we made
was actually just for testing.

237
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,892
If Chief Im isn't there, I can't--

238
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,269
Should I cancel the helicopter?

239
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,272
The other teams are done
with their research.

240
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,525
Human-like bodies,
intelligent, able to reproduce.

241
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,070
All that's left is the Emotion Engine.
Do you understand?

242
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,239
It's all up to you now.

243
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,036
Mom.

244
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,663
Yeah?

245
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,290
I have to poo-poo.

246
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,251
Hold on.

247
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,546
Did you poop?

248
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,759
No. I'm holding it,
but I can't do it anymore.

249
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,761
This wasn't in the plan.

250
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,639
Can he hold it or not?
We don't have much time.

251
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,271
Ja-in, Mom didn't bring
any spare pants for you.

252
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,648
You know what I mean, right?
You have to hold it.

253
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,245
I thought you didn't have pants.

254
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,086
Ja-in, not yet, okay?

255
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,381
Ja-in.

256
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,550
Not yet.

257
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,428
Hold it. Wait.

258
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,356
Yes, it's me.

259
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,442
Fifteenth floor. Fine so far.

260
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,947
The kid needed the bathroom.

261
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,620
Why would I tell her that?

262
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,915
She's cooperating without complaint.

263
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,672
Yes, we'll leave now.

264
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,301
The kid?

265
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,386
He finishes up by himself.

266
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,431
You two should put those on.

267
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,558
Not like they belong to anyone.

268
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,655
So this Emotion Engine,

269
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,825
it contains human feelings?

270
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,369
Human emotions?

271
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,622
Yes.

272
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,333
So, what, it's just like a human?

273
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,297
I don't get it. Why human emotions?

274
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,634
Aren't there better options?
It's the new human race.

275
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,511
Shouldn't it have something new?

276
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,765
What's wrong with human emotions?

277
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,355
When we get up there, it won't be easy
getting on the helicopter.

278
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,067
People will rush at us.
They'll beg and fight to be let on.

279
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,404
They'll push aside their own families
in order to live.

280
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,239
The funny thing is,

281
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:31,743
you'll be just the same,
pushing past them to get on.

282
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,704
And that's not wrong.

283
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,666
That's just how human emotions work.

284
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,922
That thing you have,

285
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,924
can it make regular calls?

286
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,844
And call me right away
if something happens.

287
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:53,807
Why did I tell you the third floor
was fine when you were house hunting?

288
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,475
Don't say that.

289
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,438
I'm glad you've evacuated safely, Mom.

290
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,732
Be careful, okay?

291
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,532
An-na. This place is starting to flood.

292
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,325
Listen to me.

293
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,456
Mom and Dad don't matter to you now.

294
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,916
Only Ja-in matters.

295
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,377
- You need to remember that.
- Mom.

296
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,422
What do you mean?

297
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,468
Nothing's going to happen.
The rain will stop soon.

298
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,180
Bring me new side dishes next week.

299
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,057
An-na.

300
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,102
Thank you for everything.

301
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,271
I...

302
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,358
I love you so much.

303
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:48,987
I know.

304
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,700
Mom.

305
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,871
Me too.

306
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,632
Are you done?

307
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,426
How heartwarming.

308
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,136
You and your mother.

309
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,138
So loving.

310
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,266
That's how human emotions work.

311
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,685
Not that you seem to care.

312
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,357
Yes, well,
I don't even have anyone to call.

313
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,527
Let's go. The water's already reached
the tenth floor.

314
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,881
Get out, now!

315
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,508
Ja-in!

316
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:02,978
Let's go.

317
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,235
This way.

318
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,329
Put these on.

319
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,503
It's not a big deal.
Climb up and pass the kid to me.

320
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,599
Mom, the fire's really hot.

321
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,935
It's all right, Ja-in. We're going up now.

322
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,354
Hold on tight to Mom, okay?

323
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,584
- Lift him straight up.
- Ja-in.

324
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,630
Ja-in, you go up first
and stay with this man, okay?

325
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,800
- No, I don't want to!
- Mom will be there in a second.

326
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:16,926
- You go first.
- Mom!

327
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,721
- I don't want to!
- It's just for a moment.

328
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,015
- Mom, no!
- Stay still!

329
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,308
- Ja-in!
- Mom!

330
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,685
Mom!

331
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,356
Mom, no!

332
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,316
Mom!

333
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,764
An-na!

334
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,601
- An-na, are you all right?
- Mom!

335
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,228
- I'm okay!
- Mom!

336
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,230
- Mom!
- It's okay!

337
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,232
Mom's not going anywhere, Ja-in.

338
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:15,568
- It's okay. I'll be right there.
- Don't go, Mom!

339
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,028
Wait for me, okay?

340
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,962
Mom...

341
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,262
Hello?

342
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,848
Is there anyone there?

343
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,689
Yes, please open the door.

344
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,232
What's your name?

345
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,444
Lee Ji-su.

346
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,240
Ji-su, I'm going to open this for you.

347
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,452
I'll be right back.
Just wait a second, okay?

348
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,928
Fuck, so much goddamn rain.

349
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,513
Damn, what's this watch worth?

350
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,349
C'mon! We gotta loot the building
before the rain stops.

351
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,559
Fuck, no one will know if we kill someone.

352
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,481
Ji-su!

353
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,486
Ji-su!

354
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,532
I'm here, Ji-su!

355
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,951
Open this! Ji-su!

356
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,014
An-na, where are you?

357
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,809
- An-na!
- I'm here.

358
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,482
Where's Ja-in?

359
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,488
Hurry.

360
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,581
Ja-in! It's me. Mom's here.

361
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,460
Does it hurt?

362
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,341
You have his meds, right? Where are they?

363
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,969
I lost them.

364
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,764
Mom, it hurts so much.

365
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,477
Shit. Damn it.

366
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:48,901
Mom.

367
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,819
Ja-in.

368
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,906
- Just hold on.
- Where are you going?

369
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,242
- To get medicine.
- Don't be ridiculous.

370
00:33:56,325 --> 00:34:00,246
We'll deal with it
after we get on the helicopter. An-na!

371
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,750
You can just revert the kid
to how he was this morning.

372
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,211
To be blunt, you have his data.
You can just recreate him.

373
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,421
We need to go!

374
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,589
He's dying!

375
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,674
Mom.

376
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,887
Ja-in, just hold on, okay?

377
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,778
- Who are you?
- I'm sorry. Excuse me...

378
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,322
Ja-in, hold on.

379
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,625
- I'm sorry. I'm just so desperate.
- What are you looking for?

380
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,554
Ja-in.

381
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:01,974
Ja-in.

382
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,143
Wake up, Ja-in.

383
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,145
Let's drink this, okay? Here.

384
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,023
- I'll hold him.
- Don't touch him!

385
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,025
Here, Ja-in.

386
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,821
Ja-in, open your eyes. Please?

387
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,991
You've got to drink this
to dive with Mom and play with Mom.

388
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,660
Come on, drink.

389
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,247
Ja-in.

390
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,164
Come on.

391
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,966
You want to give Ja-in up?

392
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,844
Is it because of your husband's accident?

393
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,933
Strictly speaking,
I met Ja-in because of our work.

394
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,644
I don't think I'm cut out to be a mother.

395
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,528
Who is cut out to be a mother?

396
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:05,246
The center has acknowledged
that the Emotion Engine is complete.

397
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,377
We don't have to raise
the kids ourselves anymore.

398
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,922
In a few months' time,

399
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,675
the center will retrieve Ja-in.

400
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,888
And my Yu-jin.

401
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,398
Maybe we should never have created them.

402
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,073
When will they take him?

403
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,383
Mom.

404
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,262
Mom.

405
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,265
Ja-in.

406
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,725
Mom's here.

407
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,104
I peed. I'm sorry.

408
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,315
Well done.

409
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,442
It's warm, so it's nice.

410
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,319
You okay now?

411
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,281
Yeah. Mom, hug me.

412
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,331
You know, today I fell in the water

413
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,333
and got sick,

414
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,295
but I'm happy because I get to spend
the whole day with you.

415
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,762
I thought it was a temporary lull,
but now the sun's out.

416
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,101
Use this water to wash the rag.
The tap won't work.

417
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,439
Is it over, then?

418
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,321
Yeah. And after all that hassle.

419
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,824
Is Ja-in all right?

420
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:55,041
Early this morning, the Head of Security
told me about the reassignment.

421
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,959
That I was to fetch you.

422
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,838
There's a temporary shelter
at the stopover point.

423
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,590
We're getting off there,

424
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,427
and you're going
to the final destination alone.

425
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,637
Ja-in can't go. He'll be retrieved.

426
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,519
I didn't mention this earlier, did I?

427
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,649
You thought

428
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,069
I wouldn't come if I knew?

429
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,449
I thought you would, actually.

430
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,122
I'm not that interested
in the new human race.

431
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,835
I came here to see what you'd do
with Ja-in in the end.

432
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,464
It would make sense for you to leave him.

433
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,301
Why did you want to see that?

434
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,977
That's what my so-called mother did
when I was Ja-in's age.

435
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,190
She was crying harder than me
when she said she'd come back,

436
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,234
but she never did.

437
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,946
Kids never forget that kind of thing.

438
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,449
So I thought watching you leave alone

439
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,119
might make me feel slightly better.

440
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,041
"Ah, I'm not the only one
who was abandoned."

441
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,044
"There are others like her."

442
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,464
"That's just what humans are like."

443
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,263
That's what I wanted to be sure of
on the day the world ends.

444
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,725
Some people take comfort in such things.

445
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,251
Damn it.

446
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,003
Let's go.

447
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,255
Ja-in.

448
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,757
- Let's go.
- Mom!

449
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,301
Mom!

450
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,887
I'm sorry. Take care.

451
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,104
Say, "Ah."

452
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,930
- Are you all right?
- Mom!

453
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,098
- Mom!
- Come on.

454
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,434
- I'll carry him.
- Mom!

455
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,435
Mom.

456
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,480
Let's go.

457
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,217
Please, we need help!

458
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,762
What do I do now?

459
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,015
Hey, it's okay.

460
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,894
Help us. Please!

461
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,772
What are you doing? We have to go!

462
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,652
I'm sorry.

463
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:59,493
Mom, why is that lady sick?

464
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,288
Well,

465
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,582
she's not sick.

466
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,251
She's having a baby.

467
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,379
Were you like that?

468
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,132
Did you hurt as well?

469
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:22,600
Ja-in.

470
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,020
Mom's a little tired.
Can you come down for a second?

471
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:26,937
Nuh-uh.

472
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,065
Mom's tired, Ja-in. Come down.

473
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,617
One more flight. Come on.

474
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,204
Let's go.

475
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:50,127
- What are you doing? We're almost there!
- Why do I have to leave him?

476
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,340
Why can't I just take him with me?

477
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,592
Listen. It's not--

478
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,636
You said I have to go alone. How?

479
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,472
How can I leave him behind?

480
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:03,557
Mom.

481
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,352
Ja-in.

482
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,271
I'm sorry. Mom's not mad.

483
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,358
Just calm down and think about it.

484
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,860
I found it strange as well.

485
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,570
With Chief Im and her kid dead,

486
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,989
Ja-in's the only one left.

487
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:23,452
He's crucial
if the center wants to get anything done.

488
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,705
There must be some mistake.

489
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,123
I'm certain.

490
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,765
"July 7th, 8:27 a.m."

491
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:49,186
"The Darwin Center informs Lead Gu An-na
of the following instructions

492
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,146
prior to her rescue."

493
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,065
"One. The Darwin Center,

494
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,401
an unofficial research institute
under the UN,

495
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,820
will exert every effort
to prevent human extinction

496
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,113
following this disaster."

497
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,199
"Two. Dr. Gu has been appointed

498
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,661
as one of
the 49 special operations researchers."

499
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,705
"She will report immediately

500
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,708
to the temporary research lab
to complete the Emotion Engine."

501
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,961
"Three. Dr. Gu will cooperate fully
with all measures necessary

502
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,505
to fulfill the two objectives above."

503
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,633
That concludes the procedure.

504
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,844
Handing over the appointee.

505
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,387
Good work.

506
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,765
Dr. Gu, effective immediately,

507
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,811
we are taking back the center's property,
the data of Newman-77.

508
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,867
What is this?

509
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,201
Get those off him now!

510
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:49,163
You said he could come with me.
Tell them to let him go!

511
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,875
You want to know something?

512
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,211
Chief Im didn't drown.
She fled with her kid.

513
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,381
Said she'd rather die today
than abandon her daughter.

514
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,175
You, on the other hand...

515
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,136
I heard you tried to give him up.

516
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:09,266
Be honest.
You knew this was going to happen.

517
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,480
This is just how human emotions work.

518
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,690
Let's not make this harder.

519
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,942
Say your goodbyes.

520
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,201
Extract it. We're short on time.

521
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,289
Wait.

522
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,714
Are you all insane?

523
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,424
Don't touch him!

524
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,301
I said don't touch him!

525
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:49,056
I'm going to kill you!

526
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,642
I'll kill every one of you!

527
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,104
Please.

528
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,357
Wait, please.

529
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,650
Please stop.

530
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,069
Please let him live.

531
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,863
Don't kill him.

532
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:09,451
I'll make the Emotion Engine, I promise.
Please don't do this.

533
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,410
Dr. Gu.

534
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,206
You achieved good results with Ja-in.

535
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:20,254
That's why we require him
to build another Emotion Engine.

536
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,006
Isn't that what you said yourself?

537
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,800
Please.

538
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,929
Please, I'm begging you. Please.

539
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,599
Or

540
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,727
just until the temporary shelter.

541
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:40,065
Let him come with me
until the temporary shelter.

542
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,608
Please.

543
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,445
Did you really think
there'd be a temporary shelter?

544
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,128
Dr. Gu.

545
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,547
The rest of us

546
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,550
will all die here.

547
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,469
You're the only one leaving.

548
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,880
Ja-in.

549
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,912
Your personal items, please.
Security reasons.

550
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,813
Experimental subject data retrieved.
Proceeding to the launch site.

551
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:16,555
Dr. Gu, this is Lee Hwi-so,
the director of Isabela Lab.

552
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:19,975
Since you just joined us,
let me repeat the mission briefing.

553
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:25,731
Within 15 minutes, tens of thousands
of meteorite fragments will fall on Earth.

554
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,526
Most life on Earth
will become extinct as a result.

555
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,697
Thus, to prevent human extinction,
the Darwin Center

556
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,742
launched seven rockets
from sites around the world this morning.

557
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,703
We are now the last survivors of mankind.

558
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,706
One moment.

559
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,880
Humankind must now evolve on its own

560
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,716
to enable its survival
in the aftermath of the Great Flood,

561
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,302
using our knowledge and technology.

562
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,513
Our goal is
a minimum viable human population,

563
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:02,142
and our team's task is
the creation of "mother and child."

564
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,312
At our destination, Isabela Lab,

565
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,856
we are able to produce
physical human bodies,

566
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,107
but you are the only one,

567
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:13,445
Dr. Gu, who can replicate human emotions
by completing the Emotion Engine.

568
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,740
Let me tell you
about your mission, Dr. Gu.

569
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,950
Since the child is complete...

570
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,829
you now want me to create the mother?

571
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,040
Do you have a plan?

572
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,048
I'll set the experimental subject
as the mother of a child,

573
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,550
and I'll make the child disappear.

574
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:41,306
While searching for the child,
the subject will face many obstacles.

575
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:45,727
If she fails,
she'll go back to the start and try again.

576
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:49,940
If, after countless repetitions,
she finds the child--

577
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,483
What if she doesn't?

578
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:55,487
That will mean the extinction of humanity.

579
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,742
Dr. Gu?

580
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,911
This is Beagle 6.

581
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:06,540
Debris of the asteroids hit our engine.
Likely leaking oxidizer.

582
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,000
Can you report
the status from your visual?

583
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:34,484
Mom, wake up. Our home is a swimming pool!

584
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,114
Ja-in.

585
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:44,161
What's happening?
Why is our place like this?

586
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:47,831
The water came in when you were sleeping.
It kept coming and coming!

587
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,334
Hello?

588
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,462
Is this Dr. Gu An-na
from Emotion Engine Dev Team 3?

589
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,797
Yes. Who is this?

590
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:59,593
Son Hee-jo from Security Team 1.
I'll be brief since it's an emergency.

591
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,303
How flooded is your home?

592
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,346
- The water's--
- Mom!

593
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,849
Dr. Gu, listen.
You need to evacuate immediately.

594
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,935
- Mom, I had a dream, and I drew it.
- I'm almost there.

595
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,563
- Wanna see, regardless?
- The third floor will flood soon.

596
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:12,522
Evacuate upward.

597
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,442
- Chief Im was our first choice.
- I sent it to your phone. Look!

598
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,818
She just passed away.

599
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,905
- No time to pack. Leave now.
- I sent it to your phone, Mom.

600
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,699
- Look at my drawing!
- Ja-in, Mom's on the phone!

601
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,910
Dr. Gu? Are you unable to talk right now?

602
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,536
No, it's okay. Go on.

603
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:30,624
Evacuate upward as soon as possible,
and make sure you bring Ja-in with you.

604
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:34,753
In a few months' time,
the center will retrieve Ja-in.

605
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:35,837
And my Yu-jin.

606
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:40,175
They're our most important assets.
Just raise him until then.

607
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,135
When will they take him?

608
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,265
Hello? Dr. Gu, are you there?

609
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,351
The center is retrieving Ja-in today.
Make sure you--

610
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,150
Shin Ja-in, get up. Come on.

611
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,695
You won't even look at my drawing,

612
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,990
and you won't do anything I want to do--

613
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,701
Shin Ja-in. Look at me.

614
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,620
You need to listen to Mom today.

615
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,747
No drawing or swimming. Not today.

616
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,124
- What about diving?
- No diving either.

617
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,043
Today you have to stay close to Mom.

618
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,963
Don't follow any strangers
that tell you to go with them.

619
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,048
If you're a good boy today,

620
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:23,385
Mom will go swimming and diving
with you next time. Understand?

621
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,178
Answer me.

622
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:26,805
You're lying.

623
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:27,722
What?

624
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,308
Why am I always six years old?

625
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,977
I was six yesterday,

626
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,145
and the day before yesterday,

627
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,523
and the day before that! Why?

628
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,733
What are you talking about?
Come on. Piggyback.

629
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,495
Shush! Stop crying!

630
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,164
- Hi.
- Be quiet!

631
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,332
Excuse me.

632
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,084
Mom said not to cry!

633
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,336
Everyone, did you see?

634
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,838
It happened just as I said.

635
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,673
This is all the will of God.

636
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:04,551
We must offer up a sacrifice
to be forgiven of our sins!

637
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,511
- Amen!
- Amen!

638
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:12,017
Hurry up! I said move!

639
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:16,146
What are you doing? Hurry up!

640
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,613
Get a move on!

641
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,076
Let's go!

642
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,788
Dr. Gu An-na!

643
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,915
Are you here, Dr. Gu An-na?

644
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,667
Dr. Gu An-na!

645
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,865
Ja-in, climb up.

646
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,216
Ja-in!

647
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,390
Shin Ja-in!

648
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,691
Ja-in.

649
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:12,929
Ja-in!

650
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,385
Are you all right?

651
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,637
God, you scared me.

652
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:59,142
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Son Hee-jo from Security Team 1.

653
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:00,935
I just need to film this.

654
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:05,398
July 7th, 7:55 a.m.
Lead Researcher Gu confirmed alive.

655
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,900
Newman-77 unaccounted for.

656
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,820
Hey, this way.
The helicopter will land on the rooftop.

657
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:13,198
My son fell in the water.

658
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,115
Wait!

659
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:15,742
He didn't.

660
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:16,659
Here.

661
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,120
I took a photo. It seemed off.

662
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:22,707
I saw a kid going up alone
just after spotting you from over there.

663
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:23,875
That's him, right?

664
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,337
Ja-in!

665
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,714
Shin Ja-in!

666
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,845
What are you thinking?

667
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,057
You think someone took him?

668
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,935
I told you. I saw him go up by himself.

669
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,229
My son would never just leave me.

670
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,438
Ja-in!

671
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,067
Shin Ja-in!

672
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,195
An-na.

673
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,114
There's no time for this. We have to go.

674
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,491
- Let me go.
- For God's sake.

675
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:59,118
I told you. We'll find him
and bring him to the rooftop!

676
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,122
Where is he?

677
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,041
Give me that.

678
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,002
I won't say it twice.

679
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,296
Where is my son?

680
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,095
An-na, we'll all die at this rate.

681
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,180
Let's get up there first, okay?

682
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,017
What did you do with him?

683
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,603
What do you mean?
I've never even met the kid!

684
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:40,118
If we took him,
why would I show you a photo?

685
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,331
We want to find him too, and quickly.

686
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,543
Take my hand.

687
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,211
I said take it!

688
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:53,381
I thought you wanted them to take him!
Why're you acting like this?

689
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,718
Don't you dare lay a finger on him.

690
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,470
- I'll kill you.
- What?

691
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,648
An-na!

692
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:16,946
Mom! Don't go!

693
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,948
Mom!

694
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:22,035
- Mom! Let go of me!
- An-na!

695
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:22,994
Damn it.

696
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,747
Don't move! I'll come get you!

697
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:11,834
Is someone in there?

698
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,754
Yes, I'm here.

699
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:19,342
Wait, is your name Ji-su?

700
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:23,096
Yes. How did you know?

701
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,476
Never mind, Ji-su.

702
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,727
Hold on, okay?

703
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,187
I'll open this for you.

704
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,648
You don't have to.

705
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,485
These older guys tried earlier
and they couldn't.

706
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,949
No, Ji-su. I'll open it.

707
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,117
Just hold on.

708
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:18,651
Yes, I'm here.

709
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,028
Ji-su, just hold on.

710
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,280
I'll be right back.

711
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:24,782
I promise I'll get you out. Just hold on!

712
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,171
Fuck, what the...

713
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:53,246
It can't be helped.
Let's put these on and return them later.

714
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,792
Everyone must've gone up to the rooftop.

715
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,461
Your grandpa will be there too.
Don't worry.

716
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:01,796
Huh?

717
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:09,637
But how did you know
that I was on my way to my grandpa's?

718
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,560
Ji-su.

719
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,481
I have to go look for my son. I lost him.

720
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,569
Be careful.

721
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:41,419
Ji-su.

722
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,632
I don't even know what I'm saying,

723
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:51,554
but I'm going to die
soon after I leave this apartment.

724
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:58,644
If you happen to see a six-year-old boy
about this tall called Shin Ja-in,

725
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:03,399
could you tell him
that his mom is looking for him?

726
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:08,362
I heard something when I was trapped.

727
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:10,573
Some people,

728
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:14,035
they were asking a kid some questions.

729
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:17,455
First they asked him where his mom was,

730
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:20,958
then, "Where do you live?"
and, "Do you know the door code?"

731
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,921
And then? Ji-su, can you remember more?

732
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,131
What kind of people
do you think they were?

733
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:30,760
I heard them
dragging something on the floor.

734
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,319
Thank you, Ji-su.

735
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:50,655
I have to go. Take care.

736
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,246
Damn it.

737
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,164
Damn!

738
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:07,672
Fuck!

739
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:09,590
Damn it.

740
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,275
Hey, use this.

741
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,414
Hey, that's enough. Let's go.

742
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,623
No, let go.

743
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,125
Fuck, I'm so pissed.

744
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,837
Why'd you freaking stay in here
and make us into robbers?

745
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,673
And why leave the fucking door open?

746
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,967
Why give us hope, you know?

747
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:55,428
Who are you?

748
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:57,471
What is it?

749
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,232
Sir!

750
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:10,985
Sir, are you all right?

751
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:14,155
Who're you, barging in
on other people's business?

752
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,198
Just move along.

753
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,618
What the fuck's going on?

754
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,080
My son.

755
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:26,584
What did you do to him?

756
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:33,215
Let's just go.

757
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,637
An-na!

758
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,139
Did you find the kid?

759
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,016
I'm here! Hurry!

760
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:43,809
- These guys--
- Lock the door!

761
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,276
- Damn it!
- Shit.

762
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,111
Goddammit.

763
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:56,947
Freaking hell.

764
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,827
Fuck.

765
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,371
Come here!

766
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,009
You okay?

767
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:21,263
An-na!

768
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:24,809
An-na!

769
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,981
Die already, damn it!

770
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,288
What the hell?

771
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:50,417
Get a grip, you little shit.

772
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:51,544
Hey, get up.

773
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,045
Come here!

774
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:55,089
Damn it!

775
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,294
My arm!

776
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:35,671
You saw what happened to your friend.

777
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,882
You won't float with a broken arm.

778
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:40,009
No, it's just that the kid was on his own.

779
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:41,969
We were just talking to him for fun.

780
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:45,139
He said he lived on the third floor,
so we let him go.

781
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:47,224
I don't know where he went. I swear.

782
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:48,475
Yeah, I believe you.

783
01:09:57,484 --> 01:10:02,031
Some rough kids have shown up
and started looting empty homes.

784
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:06,952
From the looks of it,
the kid really did vanish on his own.

785
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:10,581
Any ideas? Someplace he might have gone?

786
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:12,374
I don't know.

787
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,419
He doesn't do this kind of thing.

788
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:16,921
- Why would he?
- Goodness.

789
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:21,634
You were ready to kill me earlier,
but you don't even know why your kid left.

790
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:26,513
Ja-in, open your eyes. Please?

791
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:31,060
You've got to drink this
to dive with Mom and play with Mom.

792
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:32,311
Come on, drink.

793
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:34,730
Ja-in. Come on.

794
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:57,419
Ji-su.

795
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:01,173
I have to go. Take care.

796
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:07,346
Here. This...

797
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:17,439
Ma'am.

798
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,110
How did you know about this?

799
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,667
Ji-su, come with me. You can't stay here.

800
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,170
I'm okay now.

801
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:43,882
I want to stay
with my grandma and grandpa.

802
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:47,761
This place will be flooded soon.
Come with me.

803
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,346
But, lady,

804
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,933
you wouldn't leave without Ja-in either.

805
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:58,689
I'm going to stay here.

806
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:02,568
I'll get Gu An-na there. Don't worry.

807
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:05,863
They can find the kid right away
once they get here?

808
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:08,365
Right.

809
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,159
Also,

810
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:12,286
that temporary shelter.

811
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:14,913
Where's it located exactly?

812
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:17,541
Yeah.

813
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,753
I have to go. All right, see you soon.

814
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:26,967
An-na.

815
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:32,598
Other members of my team
will soon arrive by boat.

816
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,099
They're good at finding people.

817
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:37,394
They'll comb the whole building,
so we can head straight up.

818
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:48,113
It's past time for his medicine.
I have to find him first.

819
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,533
An-na!

820
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,662
What difference does it make
if we find him first, huh?

821
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:59,041
My team will find him and bring him up!

822
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,002
Tell me, then.

823
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:07,257
Why would a kid who never leaves his mom
just disappear? There must be a reason!

824
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:10,886
Be honest. Didn't you say
you weren't sure you could raise him?

825
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:15,099
An-na.

826
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:18,977
You keep changing your mind.
Get a grip of yourself.

827
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:22,773
You know as well as I do
that this is your last day with him.

828
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:31,782
That's why.

829
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:35,160
That's why I want to find him. Please.

830
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,581
I've failed to find him every time.

831
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,419
There can't be many units with open doors.

832
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:47,214
Help me, just this once.
I'll check odd floors, you check even.

833
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,217
You take those stairs. I'll go this way.

834
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:52,469
Do me this one favor.

835
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:01,228
Why's she always asking for favors?
We've only just met.

836
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:08,193
Or have we met before?

837
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,652
I don't know!
We haven't seen a kid like that.

838
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:51,570
I swear--

839
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:08,295
Mom. You know that thing you use for work?

840
01:15:08,378 --> 01:15:09,755
Can I draw on it?

841
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:13,759
Why do you keep drawing on that?
You have lots of sketchbooks.

842
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:17,179
'Cause if I draw in my sketchbook
you don't look at it.

843
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,431
What do you mean? Of course I do.

844
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,204
Let me.

845
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:55,235
Along the Milky Way in the blue sky

846
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:02,034
A little white boat drifting by

847
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:10,459
With a single laurel tree

848
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:17,090
There sits one tiny hare

849
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:26,224
No mast upon the boat

850
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:32,481
No paddle to keep it afloat

851
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:40,614
Eun-su!

852
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:57,839
The water's lukewarm. I hope it's okay.

853
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,884
Our baby's so beautiful.

854
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:02,469
Yeah, Eun-su.

855
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:09,976
Recently, I kept dreaming about a tsunami.

856
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:13,021
It must have been a lucky dream.

857
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:18,819
Mom, I had a dream, and I drew it.

858
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:21,113
Wanna see, regardless?

859
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:28,578
I sent it to your phone, Mom.

860
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:29,830
Look!

861
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:32,624
I sent it to your phone, Mom.

862
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,627
- Look at my drawing!
- Ja-in, Mom's on the phone!

863
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:47,055
PHOTOS

864
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:35,061
An-na!

865
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,189
An-na!

866
01:19:38,064 --> 01:19:39,941
I found him. Hurry!

867
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,867
Why am I always six years old?

868
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:55,540
I was six yesterday,
and the day before yesterday,

869
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:58,710
and the day before that! Why?

870
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:01,797
How long am I going to be six?

871
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:43,004
How long am I going to be six?

872
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:57,310
Ja-in.

873
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:24,045
We'll wake you up
on the rooftop once we find Ja-in,

874
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:26,548
so you can say your goodbyes.

875
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:32,762
Let's not make this harder.

876
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:37,684
You...

877
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:42,022
won't get on the helicopter.

878
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:45,025
You died on the rooftop.

879
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:47,944
Don't you remember?

880
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,616
We've met before.

881
01:21:57,996 --> 01:21:59,205
What?

882
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,500
An-na, what did you just say--

883
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:04,711
We will take care of this. Please leave.

884
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,548
Move aside. Hey, you over there. Stop.

885
01:22:09,549 --> 01:22:11,760
Please board the helicopter.
Boss's orders.

886
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:32,989
Hey!

887
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:44,459
An-na.

888
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:46,169
An-na--

889
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:07,399
Shoot!

890
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:09,693
Shoot, now!

891
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:20,370
Good job, An-na.

892
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,878
This might hurt a little...

893
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:32,424
No, actually it hurts a lot.
But bear with it.

894
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:42,934
Look at me. You with me?

895
01:23:44,477 --> 01:23:47,397
What did you say earlier?
That we've met before?

896
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:56,573
So...

897
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:00,493
how many times has this happened?

898
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:03,538
After I left Ja-in the first time,

899
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,374
he's disappeared every time since.

900
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,168
Thousands of times.

901
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:10,837
We've had this talk before.

902
01:24:15,508 --> 01:24:19,137
And I think he knew everything
from the beginning.

903
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:21,347
So that's why he disappeared.

904
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:24,642
Didn't want his mom to abandon him again.

905
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:29,064
For a while, I didn't know
this apartment was a trap,

906
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,900
but even after I knew, I still came.

907
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:36,112
Because from here on, I need your help.

908
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:42,452
When Ja-in is upset or sulking,
he hides in a closet.

909
01:24:42,535 --> 01:24:46,164
The only unit left with its door open
is on the 30th floor.

910
01:24:46,831 --> 01:24:48,416
He's got to be in there.

911
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:50,460
The problem is--

912
01:24:50,543 --> 01:24:51,711
Our security team.

913
01:24:58,176 --> 01:24:59,052
Yeah.

914
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:01,596
I remember now.

915
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:18,113
The security team is trying to stop me
from finding Ja-in.

916
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:20,657
Just like how they took him away
in reality.

917
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:24,160
No matter what I tried,

918
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:27,956
I couldn't find him.

919
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:35,630
The security team's all over the building.

920
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,817
Same plan as last time.

921
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:57,402
No.

922
01:25:58,736 --> 01:25:59,571
Follow me.

923
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:10,623
Maybe

924
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:14,169
none of this is any use now.

925
01:26:15,253 --> 01:26:16,963
Even if I manage to find him,

926
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:20,258
what if he doesn't want to see me?

927
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,973
Target spotted on the 30th floor.
All units, move in.

928
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,025
Why?

929
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,612
You reckon he thinks
his mom abandoned him?

930
01:26:41,821 --> 01:26:46,117
If he's disappeared thousands of times,
it's not because he hates his mom.

931
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,703
He's waiting for you to find him.

932
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:52,457
His mom abandoned him,
but he doesn't hate her.

933
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:55,501
He's waiting for you somewhere,

934
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:57,921
desperately wanting to be found.

935
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,590
That's how I felt.

936
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:05,220
Go. Just go!

937
01:28:24,173 --> 01:28:25,466
I want to see it.

938
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:28,678
What you do in the end.

939
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:33,099
That was why I came here, you know.

940
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:21,082
A long time ago,

941
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:24,752
you know how Mom abandoned you?

942
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:32,635
But Mom kept forgetting. I didn't know.

943
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:37,181
I didn't know about your drawings...

944
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,602
and I didn't know you were here.

945
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:47,733
Goodbye, Ja-in.

946
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:53,698
Mom's sorry...

947
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,286
for abandoning you again.

948
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:02,290
But

949
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,377
I think I'm going to forget again.

950
01:31:12,341 --> 01:31:13,676
No.

951
01:31:15,052 --> 01:31:16,762
You didn't abandon me, Mom.

952
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:21,767
You told me to wait.

953
01:31:24,103 --> 01:31:25,021
What?

954
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,695
Back then. Ages ago.

955
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:35,781
You promised you'd come back.

956
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:38,534
You said, "Wait for me."

957
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:42,079
You whispered it.

958
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:45,541
Ja-in.

959
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:48,377
See the closet behind Mom?

960
01:31:52,423 --> 01:31:53,841
When you open your eyes,

961
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:57,303
make sure you hide in there.

962
01:31:58,971 --> 01:32:01,891
Okay? Mom will come find you, I promise.

963
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,520
Wait for me, okay?

964
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:18,574
Dr. Gu, are you all right?

965
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:27,792
Let it be me.

966
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:30,336
The experimental subject.

967
01:32:32,588 --> 01:32:34,507
Send me in with Ja-in.

968
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:41,305
He'll be waiting for me.

969
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:29,437
I've informed the other teams of our plan.

970
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:34,609
As you requested,

971
01:33:35,735 --> 01:33:38,863
both Ja-in's memories and yours
will be extracted

972
01:33:39,905 --> 01:33:41,741
and transmitted to Isabela Lab.

973
01:33:43,492 --> 01:33:46,787
Experimentation will commence
based on the memories transmitted.

974
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:50,166
If, one day, the experiment is successful,

975
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:53,210
the new human race will return to Earth.

976
01:34:46,555 --> 01:34:49,558
Ja-in, do you want to swim
over there with Mom?

977
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:53,813
You start first.

978
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:05,658
Ja-in, go!

979
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:08,369
Mom will follow you.

980
01:35:44,196 --> 01:35:46,323
I liked your idea at the briefing earlier.

981
01:35:47,533 --> 01:35:50,077
Creating emotions through experience.

982
01:35:51,036 --> 01:35:52,413
FIVE YEARS AGO

983
01:35:52,496 --> 01:35:55,624
The problem is, it takes too long.
Let's think of another way.

984
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:58,586
What if we create the baby first?

985
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:00,588
A real child,

986
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:03,299
with its own thoughts and emotions.

987
01:36:03,966 --> 01:36:05,509
We could do it in five years.

988
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:29,867
Ja-in, what's wrong?

989
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:33,412
Is it your diaper?

990
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:37,583
Ouch, it's hot!

991
01:36:43,422 --> 01:36:44,590
"Ocean."

992
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,760
"Ocean," Ja-in. Can you say it?

993
01:36:48,427 --> 01:36:49,553
"Ocean."

994
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:51,305
Say it after Mom. "Ocean."

995
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:53,349
"Ocean."

996
01:36:53,432 --> 01:36:55,059
Hm? Let's try a different one.

997
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:00,314
Mm! So yummy!

998
01:37:01,023 --> 01:37:02,399
You want to take it off?

999
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:04,443
Say, "Ah." Kimchi!

1000
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:06,237
You want kimchi?

1001
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:15,704
Here we go. All done, Ja-in.

1002
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:18,123
- All done--
- Mom...

1003
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:24,672
Ja-in.

1004
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:28,050
What did you just say?

1005
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:29,677
Mommy.

1006
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:32,513
Mommy.

1007
01:37:49,738 --> 01:37:51,532
- Mommy?
- Mommy.

1008
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:53,576
Mommy.

1009
01:37:59,748 --> 01:38:00,624
Hello.

1010
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:02,668
So you're Ja-in.

1011
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,421
Whoa!

1012
01:38:58,557 --> 01:38:59,391
Ja-in.

1013
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:06,500
Ja-in!

1014
01:40:54,256 --> 01:40:55,215
Ja-in.

1015
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:58,677
Shall we dive together?

1016
01:41:00,971 --> 01:41:02,347
I'll count to 30.

1017
01:41:34,004 --> 01:41:38,342
THE GREAT FLOOD

1018
01:41:58,362 --> 01:41:59,196
Mom.

1019
01:41:59,696 --> 01:42:01,281
Mom, wake up!

1020
01:42:02,616 --> 01:42:04,618
Mom. Wake up!

1021
01:42:58,463 --> 01:43:00,841
Mom, let's dive. Please?

1022
01:43:00,924 --> 01:43:04,094
Do it together, like yesterday.

1023
01:43:05,762 --> 01:43:06,597
You do it.

1024
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:08,891
I'll count to 30 for you.

1025
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:12,144
Set, go!

1026
01:43:14,563 --> 01:43:15,397
One,

1027
01:43:16,815 --> 01:43:17,816
two,

1028
01:43:18,817 --> 01:43:20,027
three,

1029
01:43:21,111 --> 01:43:22,237
four,

1030
01:43:23,238 --> 01:43:24,615
five,

1031
01:43:25,741 --> 01:43:27,034
six,

1032
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:29,578
seven,

1033
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:31,788
eight,

1034
01:43:33,123 --> 01:43:34,458
nine,
