What class and year are you?

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,340
I'm a first year, in Class 1. My name is Ninako Kinoshita.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,510
Ren rejected another girl.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,850
Some of those girls were notoriously cute, too.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:21,120
If someone goes out of their way for me,
of course I'd appreciate the favor.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,810
Weirdo.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,050
If you don't confess first, someone else will take her.

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,350
Do you have a crush on Ichinose?

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,190
Even if Ren has a girlfriend,
my feelings for him won't just disappear.

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:40,380
I didn't fall for him, hoping anything would come out of this.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,230
I just want him to know how happy I am to be in love.

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,010
Ren!

13

What's up?

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,130
Ren.

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,660
I...

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,800
I like you.

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,400
Thank you.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,000
But I'm sorry. I already have a girlfriend.

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,560
Yeah. I know.

20
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,010
- Huh?
- I just wanted you to know how I felt.

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,980
Will you continue to be my friend regardless?

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,590
Sure.

23
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,690
Can you really be friends with someone who rejected you?

24
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,810
I can, easy. Piece of cake.

25
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,400
You think so?

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,180
I think it'll be pretty tough.

27
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,510
Not speaking to Ren would be worse.

28
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,660
You truly love him from the bottom of your heart, don't you?

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,560
Then I guess I'll take Daiki for myself.

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
Huh?

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,800
Actually, I already confessed to him.

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,440
- What?
- I'm still waiting for a response, though.

33
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,010
Since when did you have a crush on Daiki?

34
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,600
I'm not too sure myself.

35
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,540
I always admired how honest and devoted he was to you.

36
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,660
Before I knew it, I realized I liked him.

37
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,310
Does that mean... you hate me?

38
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,620
Of course not!

- Ninako!

Good night, Mii.

42

Even if the person I like has someone they love already,

43
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,450
I can't deny the love I have for him.

44

That's all there is to this crush of mine.

Morning, Ninako.

Go right on ahead.

You're the girl who was rejected by Ren Ichinose.

How did you...

66
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,040
That's her, the one Ren rejected.

67

She apparently confessed right before summer break.

68
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,080
He shot her straight down.

69

That's what you get for confessing right at the station.

00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,250
Meanwhile Ninako's munching away without a care in the world.

168
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,100
I think girls who eat heartily are adorable.

169
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,140
If it wasn't for my job, I'd be eating the same amount.

170
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,020
Speaking of, what do you see in a blunt guy like him anyway?

171
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:51,040
Ren only looks blunt and cold. He's really kind at heart.

172
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,230
Stop it, you're embarrassing me.

173
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,840
Aw, no need to get so shy.

174
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,580
Let's run for it!

175
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,000
Ninako, wait. I need to re-tie my shoes.

176
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,500
Hurry up, we'll miss our chance...

177
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,100
Wait, you're wearing loafers.

178
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,050
Busted, huh?

179
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,170
Alright, let's ditch them.

180
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,620
Huh?

181
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,850
Ando?

182
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,790
Ando, pause!

183
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,510
Why did we just leave?

184
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,210
I couldn't stand there and do nothing
when you looked so conflicted.

185
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,690
If this one doesn't work out, move on.

186
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,580
What's the point of a love that hurts? I don't get it.

187
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,660
You'll get it one day, Ando.

188
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,090
When you have a crush like mine, it'll become obvious.

189
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,460
Someone's acting all high-and-mighty.

190
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,330
I'll give you a half thank you.

191
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,050
You're right.

192
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,840
I was having a hard time watching those two.

193
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,790
But that's still no excuse for ditching them without a word.

194
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,530
That's why you get half of my gratitude.

195
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,830
Thanks for getting me out of there.

196
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,080
Morning, Ren.

197
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,000
I want to ask about yesteday.

198
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,480
Yeah, yeah. Our bad for ditching you guys.

199
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,390
But didn't you two have more fun alone? I sure did.

200
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,280
Don't get Kinoshita involved in your flings.

201
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,790
What do you mean?

202
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:01,170
She's not like those other girls you've messed around with.

203
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,080
Dude.

204
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,300
Are you Ninako's anything?

205
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,370
You have no right butting into her relationships with people.

206
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,060
Takumi, wanna come hang at my place today? No one's home.

207
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,690
Sorry, not happening.

208
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,760
We're ending things here, okay?

209
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,180
Toodles.

210
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,910
Sure.

211
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,850
- That was -
- Besides, you're the one who's messing around.

212
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,530
Acting like nothing's happened between you and Ninako?

213
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,470
News flash big guy, but no one calls that "being kind".

214
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,100
See you in class.

215
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,890
Don't go acting coy towards the guy who rejected you.

216
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,500
Ninako, did those two bump into you on purpose?

217
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,350
No.

218
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,050
I was just a bit careless.

219
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,430
- See you in class.
- Hey wait, Ninako!

220
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,130
Is everything okay?

221
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,470
No, it's just, Ninako...

222
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,850
I mean...

223
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,450
Well...

224
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,490
Are you trying to be considerate of me?

225
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,650
Don't bother.

226
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,480
I fell for you because of your devotion to Ninako.

227
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,870
I know there's nothing I can do about it.

228
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,060
You don't mind?

229
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,830
Doesn't it bother you that I keep crushing on Ninako?

230
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,240
What are you trying to say?

231
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,910
Be clear with me, or I won't get it.

232
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,270
You're not being fair to me right now.

233
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,710
Ren.

234
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,260
I'm sorry we ran off like that yesterday.

235
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,020
It really was a thoughtless move to pull.

236
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,380
Ando.

237
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,110
The committee leader sent me over to help.

238
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,470
Welcome, come join us.

239
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,080
Could you bundle these stacks for us?

240
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,650
Sure.

241
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,560
- Here.
- Thanks.

242
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,750
Ren.

243
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,150
- I...
- We're out of trash bags.

244
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,000
I'll go grab us some more.

245
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,200
What is he, a man who only knows extremes?

246
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,410
He hates me now.

247
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,800
No, he's just being stupid...

248
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,120
Hey, woah there.

249
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
What the - what was that?

250
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,910
Sorry.

251
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,950
Ninako?

252
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,550
Sorry, I won't do that ever again.

253
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,340
Ninako, where are you?

254
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,410
Don't hide from me.

255
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,790
I think he's gone now.

256
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,630
Thanks.

257
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,580
Ren?

258
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,870
[Next Episode]

259
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,640
Right this way.

260
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,440
Take it slow, and no need to panic.

261
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,550
You're such a weirdo, Kinoshita.

262
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,930
I like the way we are now.

263
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,290
I'm fine with keeping these feelings to myself.

264
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,650
You can't expect anything from Ren
so long as he has a girlfriend.

265
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,230
Use me.

266
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,520
I'll help you forget Ren, for good.

267
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,870
[Epilogue]

268
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,790
"We figured you must be pissed off, too"?

269
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,260
Don't group me with the rest of you.

270
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,070
Ninako.

271
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,480
I saw you being pestered by a gang of girls earlier.

272
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,950
You were watching?

273
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,550
Ren's put you in a real pickle, huh?

274
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,720
It's not Ren's fault.

275
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,280
What now?

276
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,410
How can you stand up for a guy who rejected you?

277
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,900
Well...

278
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,060
Hey, could you let her go already?

279
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,480
Sayu...

280
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,340
I will, if you trade me your Line ID.

281
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,910
Sure, I don't mind.

282
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,040
What?

283
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,330
You shouldn't give your ID away to just anyone.

284
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,420
- Why not?
- Seems dangerous.

285
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,980
I can make that judgement myself.

286
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,870
- You're not even friends with this dude.
- Would you look at that?

287
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,580
They act like a couple already.

288
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,490
Now, now. There's plenty of me to go around, you two.

289
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,960
- We're not fighting over you.
- We're not fighting over you.

290
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,990
Right, sorry.

291
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,690
See? Don't trade IDs with such a player.

292
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,000
- I hope they find happiness together one day.
- We're practically classmates.

293
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,440
You barely know the dude.

294
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,500
Don't give your ID out to guys you don't know.

295
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,910
If you're so bothered, then you text me every day.
