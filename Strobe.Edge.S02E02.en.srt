1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,460
Stare at him like that, and he'll realize you still like him.

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,780
When I realized I had someone else on my mind,

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,940
I assumed I should make an effort to forget.

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,750
Were your efforts in forgetting her a success?

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,300
- Seriously?
- I enrolled here because of you.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,240
The guy my ex liked... I thought of him as my best friend.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,260
But one day, I saw them together.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,330
You could have at least tried to make an excuse.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,320
What was I supposed to say?

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,760
"You should speak up when you're not feeling well."

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,280
Ring a bell?

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,310
I just assumed I wasn't allowed to call him a friend anymore.

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,240
I promise I feel better, really.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,530
Are you Takumi's girlfriend?

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,450
No.

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,030
Then...

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,840
Do you have a crush on Ichinose?

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,200
What?

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,250
You two were lost in each other's eyes.

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,410
No, we weren't.

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,530
What makes you say that?

22
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,110
Ninako. You'll be late for your shift.

23
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,320
Ando.

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,350
I'll catch up with you at the cafe. You go ahead first.

25
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,460
You should take time off today.

26
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,590
I'll be fine. Just tell the manager I'll be running late, okay?

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,970
I need to tell this girl something.

28
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,300
I promise it's nothing big. I only want to talk.

29
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,640
Okay, see you later.

30
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,860
I don't know what you're scheming,
but mess with her anymore, and I won't forgive you.

31
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,790
Do you have a crush on her?

32
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,490
So what if I do?

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,360
But she probably likes Ichinose.

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,850
That's none of your business.

35
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,490
Right?

36
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,050
Your Margarita, and Pesto pizzas.

37
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,940
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

38
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,540
- Enjoy.
- Time to dig in.

Nothing. I was just admiring you.

What's up with that?

47
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,320
I'll share if you're still hungry.

Will you go out with me?

52
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,960
I prefer older men who are tall, rich, and handsome.

53

You tick off none of those boxes, so no. It's not happening.

Manabu, Kashiwagi, feel free to take your break.

55

I'll cook up dinner for us again.

What're you in the mood for?

Carbonara.

One carbonara made with love, coming right up!

This cafe sure is full of one-sided crushes.

60
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,800
Is something wrong?

61
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,600
Did that girl say something to you?

62
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,980
No.

63
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:10,570
Ren said he fought with an important friend of his.

64
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,790
I couldn't give him any advice,
even though he was feeling so down.

65
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,280
Are you sure about that last part?

66
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,150
That guy's always a downer.

67
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,960
But I've never seen Ren like that before.

We're not best friends anymore.

Stuff happened between us in the past.

If anything, it's way more chaotic now.

That doesn't mean we're not friends, alright?

76
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,970
Yesterday, I was just blowing off some steam.

77
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,640
Sorry for the dramatics.

78
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,090
If I'm being honest, you seriously piss me off.

79
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:47,600
But I'm too prideful to let some girl trouble
ruin our friendship. So be grateful.

80
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,080
That's some weird sense of pride you've got.

- Ando.
- What's up?

Did you come here with Ando? That's an unusual combo.

89
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,420
Yeah. He was waiting for me by the walkway.

00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,890
Why?

You don't know?

Nope. That guy's just an idiot.

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,670
Huh? He seems different today.

95

Daiki lost a bet, and is on the library committee now.

Isn't she just the cutest?

I sort of admire her.

116
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,230
Really makes me wonder
why she doesn't have a boyfriend yet.

117
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,950
That's probably because she has a crush on someone.

Would that someone be Ichinose, perhaps?

Ninako is like an open book, isn't she?

All I know is that they began talking last year,

to replace the one he broke.

00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,910
Daiki's always coming to visit Sayuri.
Do you think he's made any friends in his own class?

166
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,070
Great question.

167
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,380
Daiki! Let's grab a selfie with our group.

168
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,120
Sure.

169
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,720
- See you later.
- Yeah.

170
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,370
- Come on.
- I'm going, I'm going.

171
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,640
- Well, hurry up!
- No need to drag me...

172
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,370
That girl needs to learn about personal space.

173
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:20,690
Listen up. Be respectful, be careful,
and always stick together.

174
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,690
Got all that?

175
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,730
Yes, sir.

176
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,860
- Should we get going?
- Sounds like a plan.

177
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,150
Wrong way, Takumi.

178
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,120
Aw, come on!

179
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,610
You think this smoke will make me smarter?
[T/N: smoke at temples are known for healing effects]

180
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,440
Apparently they're more known for fixing eyes.
[T/N: smoke at temples are known for healing effects]

181
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,340
Ready, and...

182
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,720
- Enjoy.
- Thank you!

183
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,030
- Wow...
- Looks delicious!

184
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,090
Now that's matcha.

185
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,440
They apparently pack it with ten times the flavor here.

186
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,570
Tamaki, you should get a cone.

187
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,250
I'm choosing croquette over ice cream.

188
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,110
- Yummy!
- That looks good, too.

189
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,820
- Right?
- This is really good.

190
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,900
Let's snag a shot with the Yoritomo statue.
[T/N: first shogun of the Kamakura shogunate]

191
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,190
- Sure.
- Woah, there it is.

192
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,530
- It's bigger than I thought.
- Right?

193
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,340
Let's all stand here.

194
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,060
Hurry up, Ren.

195
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,800
You stand here.

196
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,440
Ready?

197
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,040
Say cheese!

198
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,190
How's that?

199
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,170
- Looks great!
- Right?

200
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,820
- I like it.
- Yeah.

201
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,870
Yeah, nice shot.

202
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,110
Come on, Ninako. We're leaving you!

203
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,200
Wait up!

204
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,450
Just don't get lost, okay?

205
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,110
- I won't.
- Hurry!

206
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,480
Wait, stand there.

207
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,430
Ready? Say cheese!

208
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,340
[No service]

209
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,280
I'm out of reach...

210
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,210
What should I do?

211
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,270
Come on!

212

Wait up!

213
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,500
You're too fast!

214
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,750
You're in the way, ugly!

215
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,700
Ugly...

216
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,700
Kinoshita.

217
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,440
There you are.

218
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,220
Ren.

219
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,890
You found her?

220
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,580
Great.

221
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,220
Where are you guys?

222
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,240
That's close to our next stop. We'll walk on over.

223
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,620
See you in a bit.

224
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,150
I'm glad he found her.

225
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,250
I have to use the restroom. I'll catch up to you two, okay?

226
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,610
Sure.

227
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,980
Not coming along?

228
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,190
Thanks for lending me your hoodie.

229
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,500
Sure.

230
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,280
I told Yutaro we'd be waiting for them here.

231
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,900
Really? Thanks.

232
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,930
Our past doesn't bother me anymore.

233
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,930
So don't let it bother you too, okay?

234
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:08,060
If it doesn't bother you,
why haven't you told your friends we're exes?

235
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,080
Is it because you can't forgive me?

236
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,600
Or maybe because the whole thing
is awful to even think about?

237
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,350
It's because it's not worth mentioning.

238
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,610
I regret breaking up with you, Uehara.

239
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,170
Saying that now won't change anything, you know?
Especially because I have a boyfriend.

240
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,080
I know.

241
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,850
Then do your best to forget and move on, okay?

242
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,820
I'll certainly make an effort to act normal.

243
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,710
Are you cold?

244
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,140
No.

245
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,610
I shouldn't have taken your hoodie.
Let's see if I have anything...

246
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,990
I'm not cold at all. I promise.

247
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,670
Really?

248
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,250
Really.

249
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:33,950
Fine. But if you ever feel cold, I'll warm you right back up.

250
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,010
So come at me.

251
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,160
Okay. Sure.

252
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,980
Pause.

253
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,670
I... I was only joking.

254
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,420
I didn't realize you make jokes like that.

255
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,360
You definitely got me.

256
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,630
I know it wasn't funny.

257
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,080
I slipped up, big time.

258
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,200
I'm so embarrassed.

259
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:48,010
The only reason Ren is able to joke like that...

260
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,450
The only reason he laughs when our eyes meet...

261
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,010
is because he's at ease with me.

262
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:07,010
Because he thinks
I don't want to be anything more than friends.

263
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,670
Ren and I are only friends.

264
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,750
We can remain this close
because we're friends, and nothing more.

265
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,780
Even though I'm right at his side...

266
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,870
I'm the closest...

267
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:40,530
yet furthest I've been from him.

268
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,340
Ninako!

269
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,210
I told you not to get lost!

270
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,850
- Sorry.
- I'm glad he found you.

271
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,730
- I didn't even realize I'd gotten lost.
- Really? I'm so glad.

272
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,060
Look, it's Gacchan.

273
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,800
Yo.

274
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,300
See you guys later.

275
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,100
It's getting late. How about we all go sightseeing, together?

276
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,020
I think... it'd be difficult to hang out as one big group.

277
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,960
Getting chummy with classmates is equally as important.

278
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,440
I mean...

279
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,450
Sure, why not? Let's all go around together.

280
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,490
If you say so.

281
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,890
Come on, let's all take a big group selfie together.

282
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,900
How considerate of you.

283
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,990
Or is that just your composure speaking?

284
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,250
Do I look composed to you?

285
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,440
Whatever. You just keep on
being friends with her, Mr. Considerate.

286
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,750
Ready?

287
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,440
- Can I squeeze in?
- Sure.

288
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,350
- Is that Ren's hoodie?
- Move right a little.

289
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,720
Yeah.

290
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,610
- Or maybe left.
- I see.

291
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,590
Which way should I stand?

292
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,100
Takumi, make a funny face for us.

293
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,700
That's not in my repertoire.

294
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,470
What? I wanna see.

295
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,290
I wonder where your keychain from Ren went.

296
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,480
Me too.

297
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,750
Why not ask him for a new one?

298
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,690
That's definitely a bit much.

299
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,610
Especially if we're just friends.

300
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,590
And are you okay being "just friends" forever?

301
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,740
This is awesome.

302
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,480
Aw, how cute!

303
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,300
I'll get this as a souvenir for Ritsuko.

304
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,000
If it's for a girl, get her something else.

305
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,680
- Why?
- Seriously?

306
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,400
Just go for it.

307
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:25,410
A person will always appreciate someone
going out of their way for them.

308
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,970
Such wise words, Ren.

309
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,770
Then I'm getting this.

310
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,390
I sure hope she'll appreciate it...

311
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,820
You're not getting anything yourself?

312
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,950
No, I don't think now's the time.

313
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,920
Ninako! Sorry I'm late.

314
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,150
Let's go.

315
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,380
Come on.

316
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,630
See you, Director.

317
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,260
What should I do now?

318
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,940
I don't think I'll be able to hold back these feelings forever.

319
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,610
- I have a crush on Kinoshita.
- What?

320
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,070
Give this back to Ninako. I bet she'd appreciate it.

321
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,150
- Don't say that.
- When else would I tell you?

322
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,570
I want to be Ren's girlfriend.

323
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,240
[Epilogue]

324
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,930
Thanks for lending me your hoodie.

325
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,010
Sure.

326
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,870
I told Yutaro we'd be waiting for them here.

327
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,460
Really? Thanks.

328
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,440
It's Enoshima!

329
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,770
I'd love to go there one day.

330
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,250
Let's go the next time we're here.

331
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,970
I meant we could go as the whole group.

332
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,400
Right.
