1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,890
I have a feeling.

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,870
Someday, in the near future,
I won't be able to hold back these feelings of mine.

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,040
I like Kinoshita. You deserve to hear it from me.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,000
Directly.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,870
Toss it away if you want.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,940
Or return it to Ninako. She might appreciate that.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,270
I don't want to be just friends.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,660
I want to be Ren's girlfriend.

[How to make your crush fall in love with you]

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,770
Sir, what sort of girl is your type?

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,050
What inspired that question?

12
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:54,060
I just wanted to know what a guy looks for in a woman.

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,580
My type, huh?

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,300
I'll be clocking out.

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,800
- Sure.
- See you again.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,130
Give me a sec, Ritsuko.

17
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,440
Let's head out together.

18
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,960
Wait, Ritsuko.

Ritsuko. (Support Admin Watch on

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,180
I love you.

21
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,650
How aren't you discouraged yet?
I haven't exactly been nice to you.

22
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,730
But you have.

23
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,080
You even kept that keychain.

24
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm imposing on that kindness of yours, you know?

25
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,880
You're forcing your feelings onto me like a kid.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,010
You're not my type at all.

27
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,550
If you've never dated a guy not your type, give me a chance.

28
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,890
I'll overcome your preferences.

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,210
Alright, that's enough.

30
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,100
Sorry about him, Kashiwagi.

31
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,080
Manabu, you come with me.

32
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,840
Cheeky kid.

33
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,560
What if Kashiwagi quits because of your pestering?

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,690
She turned you down, so be a gentleman and back off, alright?

35
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,700
Besides, you're no match for her, Manabu.

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,340
Is that any reason for me to give up?

37
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,660
I can't ever become someone that I'm not.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,580
That's why I have to give it my all.

39
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,200
I have to put in ten times the effort
for whatever confidence I lack.

40
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,010
But I don't want Ritsuko to quit either.

41
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,040
So I'll cool it a bit.

42
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,580
This is the first time I've seen Manabu so worked up over a girl.

43
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,670
Really?

44
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,350
Let me answer your question from before.

45
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,650
Sincere effort is guaranteed to be a straight shot to the heart.

46
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:24,660
And if you're eyeing someone at school,
Sports Day is a great chance to prove yourself.

47
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,400
Sports Day?

48
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,670
First, we need to pick our representative for the cheer team.

49
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:34,020
Each second-year class is required to send a rep
to join the third-years.

50
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,800
Any volunteers?

51
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,330
I volunteer.

52
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,470
I'll join the cheer team.

53
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,080
My name is Kyoichi Miyoshi, a Hikarigasaki High alum.

54
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,250
Each year, the school invites alumni like myself

55
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,450
to lead the cheer teams for Sports Day.

56
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,590
- I'm excited to work with you all in team D.
- Likewise.

57
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,580
It's our pleasure.

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,380
I can't hear you.

59
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:09,230
Do you really think mumbling will encourage anyone?

60
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,300
Let me hear you loud and clear.

61
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,460
Louder.

62
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,990
Give me more!

63
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,220
Put your whole heart into it!

64
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,980
Alright, now it's time to practice our routine. You all ready?

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,290
[Episode 4]

66
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,480
How was cheer practice, Ninako?

67
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,470
Why are you...

68
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,710
I had something I wanted to tell you.

69
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,590
What is it?

70
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,250
Did Takumi tell you about me?

71
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,260
Is it all true?

72
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:16,440
Did you... really use him to...

73
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,040
Get closer to my crush? Yes.

74
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,620
I used him to get to Ichinose.

75
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,100
What?

76
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,220
But it didn't work.

77
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,420
I tried to push my feelings onto him when I had the chance...

78
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,020
only for him to quickly turn me down.

79
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,950
I wouldn't have any issue if I was the only one left heartbroken.

80
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,800
Except, I ended up ruining the friendship
between Ichinose and Takumi as well.

81
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,620
It's the one thing I truly regret.

82
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,890
That's why I asked that question the other day.

83
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,060
About whether or not you liked Ichinose.

84
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,680
Because if that were the case,

85
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,250
I thought your feelings would only trouble him.

86
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,590
Just like mine did.

87
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,720
Ninako.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,270
You don't like Ichinose anymore, do you?

89
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,540
The guy my ex liked... I actually clicked with him quite a bit.

90
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,560
I thought of him as my best friend.

91
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,970
We're never going back to being best buds, I suppose.

92
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:51,060
Can't friends be friends, even if the feeling's not mutual?

93
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,730
No, not anymore.

94
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,850
That's a relief.

95
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,120
Ren's hyper-focused right now.

96
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,910
He sure takes his job seriously.

97
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,630
Yeah, and all for Sports Day, too.

98
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,230
Don't let his expression fool you.
I bet he's just thinking about dinner.

99
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,450
Ren, what's on your mind right now?

100
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,500
I was thinking about how I wanted fried shrimp for dinner today.

101
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,130
Holy cow, you were on the mark, Takumi.

102
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,730
Seriously, dude? Think about something else.

103
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,940
Shove off. My mind, my business.

104
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,090
I can't tell if Ren and Ando get along, or not.

105
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,000
For your information? We don't.

106
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,290
I'm going to go wash these brushes.

107
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,010
Did you need to wash something too?

108
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,370
Yeah, my hands.

109
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,600
You seem down today. Is everything okay?

110
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,210
What, me? I'm totally fine.

111
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:45,310
It bothers me when you're not feeling well.

112
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,040
Says the one who's more worried about dinner tonight.

113
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,620
You were listening?

114
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,810
Yeah. I got a kick out of that.

115
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:12,010
Ren, you have an interesting relationship with Ando.

116
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,010
What were you two like in middle school?

117
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,410
I was sort of made into the class loner at our middle school.

118
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,550
The only one who spoke to me despite that, was Ando.

119
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,380
He said whoever he spoke to was his business.

120
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,220
And honestly, that attitude of his saved me.

121
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,520
If I had it my way, I want to tell him everything.

122
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,770
I want him to know exactly how I feel deep inside.

123
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,200
You're the first person I've ever spoken to about this.

124
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,020
Impulsiveness is getting the best of me.

125
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,410
I wouldn't have even bothered, if you weren't the one listening.

126
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,250
I want to tell him everything.

127

And yet... (Support Admin Watch on

I'm happy to hear you trust me as a good friend.

129
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,980
See you back in the classroom.

130
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,910
What were you two gossiping about?

131
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,360
Taking the initiative now that you've given me a heads up?

132
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,630
Then you take a swing.

133
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,710
And my leg goes here?

134
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,160
- Actually, swing this way.
- Like this?

135
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,420
And then... right, you have to give a shout.

136
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,120
- Give a shout.
- A shout?

137
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,140
Phew, I'm beat.

138
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,850
That was quite the workout.

139
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,220
Yeah.

140
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,600
Ando, you were right.
Teaching someone else helps me concentrate.

141
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,950
Thanks for keeping me company.

142
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:06,010
No problem. Anything for the girl I love.

143
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,210
How can I surpass Ren?

144
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,180
What should I do to turn your heart in my favor?

145
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,000
I like Ren.

146
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,220
That's an unshakable, undeniable fact.

147
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,060
There's only one answer I can give him.

148
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,870
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,540
Why does it have to be Ren?

150
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,960
I don't like Ren anymore, though.

151
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:18,450
A while ago, I lost the keychain he gave me in our first year.

152
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,550
So I'm taking it as a sign to finally give up.

153
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,140
Thanks for helping me out today.

154
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,230
Ren treasures whatever bond they share.

155
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,760
As does Ando.

156
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,480
I can't stand to destroy it again.

157
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,860
Because I thought your feelings would only trouble Ichinose.

158
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,220
Just like mine did.

159
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,040
There's only one thing to do.

160
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,220
I have to end it here.

161
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,380
I have to give up on Ren, for good.

162
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,220
Did you give Ninako any weird ideas?

163

I told you I wouldn't forgive you if -

164
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,420
I didn't give her any "weird ideas".

165
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,990
Besides,

166
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,840
it's not like you'd forgive me anyway.

167
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,720
Look. If you like Ren, just tell it to him straight, okay?

168
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,420
I have my own way of doing things.

169
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:42,100
And could you please try harder with Ninako?

170
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,590
You're not making it any easier for me.

171
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,340
You sure don't pick your methods when it comes to Ren.

172
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,620
Is that all you wanted to tell me?

173
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,480
I need to get going soon.

174
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,850
Of course I like you.

175
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,310
Wait.

176
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,750
Were you really only using me to get a shot at Ren?

177
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,450
That might've been the case at first.

178
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,010
But after spending time together...

179
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,590
I did grow to love you.

180
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,680
So? Do you believe me now?

181
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,080
You're awful, you know that?

182
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,040
I treasured you back then.

183
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,600
Whatever, it's in the past now.

184
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,260
So? What's up?

185
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm going to quit working part-time at Luce next month.

186
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,430
What?

187
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,500
Is it my fault?

188
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,600
No. I was always planning on quitting around this time.

189
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,170
I'm going to go study abroad in London next semester.

190
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,880
I want to work as a translator after I graduate.

191
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,180
So I've been studying desperately to attend a school overseas.

192
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,420
Now that I have the chance, I absolutely want to go.

193
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,590
I can't pursue a relationship with you, because I'll be leaving.

194
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,460
You need to give up.

195
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,830
For real?

196
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,410
Bummer. I bet I was so close to having you fall for me, too.

197
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,770
I bet you're right.

198
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,630
That's a dirty move to pull when you're leaving so soon.

199
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,060
I'm telling you now because I'm leaving.

200
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,660
I want you to give the next person you love

201
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,050
the same kind of earnest attitude you showed me.

202
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,240
That way, you can surpass any sort of expectations

203
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,840
the other party may have.

204
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,420
Ritsuko... Doesn't that mean you like me?

205
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,680
Thank you for giving it your all for me.

206
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,000
We will now teach you all the cheer routine for Sports Day.

207
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,890
Please follow Kinoshita's lead.

208
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,410
Kinoshita, if you please.

209
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,630
Yes, sir.

210
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,110
Hello there.

211
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:26,050
When I give you all the verbal signal,

212
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,020
please punch your fists this way.

213
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,180
And then...

214
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,650
Sorry, the other way.

215
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,880
Next, we go... left?

216
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,000
Sorry, this was the right way.

217
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,410
Great. After that...

218
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,040
We can't hear you back here.

219
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,940
Your instructions aren't clear either.

220
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,240
I'm not exactly motivated to cheer with you at the helm.

221
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,140
Pipe down.

222
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,510
That's no way to treat someone who's doing their best.

223
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,550
You okay?

224
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,840
I was turned down, for good.

225
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,730
I see. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

226
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,210
What about you, Ninako?

227
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,840
Are those dudes' comments still bothering you?

228
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,140
I have something that I'm wishing for with all my heart.

229
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,640
But that wish is something I have to give up on.

230
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,890
What do you think I should do?

231
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,480
How do people manage to move on?

232
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,180
You have to believe you're giving up for a better cause.

233
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,870
At least, that's what I would do.

234
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,100
I have to give up on Ren...

235
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,050
to protect whatever both Ando and Ren hold dear.

236
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,710
That's a better cause as any.

237
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,850
Right.

238
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,250
That's what I have to believe.

239
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,170
Make a strike out left on my cue.

240
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,850
Ready, and punch!

241
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,790
Uh... guys?

242
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,840
Sorry, I think most of us were just caught off guard.

243
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,210
We can hear you loud and clear today!

244
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:33,020
I need to take this seriously if I want anyone to follow suit.

245
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,180
So who's with me? Ready, and...

246
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,840
Alright, let's take it from the top.

247
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,000
Here.

248
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,970
Great job today.

249
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,930
Thanks.

250
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,030
Sorry.

251
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,040
About what?

252
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,940
I shouldn't have spoken up the other day.

253
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,450
I only added to the pressure you must've been feeling.

254
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,530
That's not true.

255
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,310
You inspired me to get my act together.

256
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,670
So if anything, I should be thanking you.

257
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,750
I'm going to go get changed.

258
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,180
Kinoshita.

259
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,000
I feel like something's been bothering you recently.

260
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,250
I'm fine. You heard me leading the class today.

261
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,490
Can't I be the one to listen?

262
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,430
You're the one who said speaking up helps, remember?

263
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,260
I want to help you, in any way I can.

264
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,430
I can't tell him a thing.

265
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:46,250
Not about how I love him, nor about how I'm giving up.

266
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,830
Thanks.

267
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,850
I'm glad I have a great friend like you.

268
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,490
I can't say anything to him.

[Hikarigasaki High School - Sports Day]

270

The opening ceremony of the Hikarigasaki High Sports Day
[Team D]

271
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,890
will be commencing shortly.

272
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,200
Ninako?

273
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,010
You don't look too good. Are you okay?

274
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,250
I keep getting nervous thinking about cheering later today...

275
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,890
Ando.

276
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:30,220
I'm going to confess to Kinoshita after Sports Day today.

[Next Episode]

278
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,700
Please don't give up on Ninako.

279
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,500
I won't lose.

280
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,120
You'll find the confidence to run without hesitating.

281
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,100
Kinoshita, I like you.

282
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,940
Even if you have someone else in your heart.

283
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,660

[Epilogue]

285
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,010
What were you two gossiping about?

286
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,090
Taking the initiative now that you've given me a heads up?

287
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,800
You said... we were still barely friends, right?

288
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,080
Well, I'd like us to stay that way, too.

289
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:37,580
But I don't care if it all falls apart,

290
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,270
and I lose you for good.

291
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,720
Because this time, I'm not backing down.

292
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,060
I'm making my move, too.

293
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,730
Fine.

294
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,770
Bring it on.

295
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,230
I'm not handing her to you.

296
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,470
You stole the words right from my mouth.

297
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,270
- Stupid Ren.
- Stupid Ando.
