1
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:19,082
He is someone who is
always helping me. Mr. Sakumoto.

2
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:22,919
I had heard
that you were a former athlete.

3
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:25,380
I think that it's amazing how you have

4
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:27,215
found another path for yourself,

5
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:30,176
even after ending
your career as an athlete.

6
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:32,887
It's not something that everyone can do.

7
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:49,487
ITO - THANKS FOR TODAY.
MR. SAKUMOTO REALLY ENJOYED IT!

8
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,073
ALSO, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,

9
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:54,617
BUT I MET
MIYAUCHI AT A WEDDING THE OTHER DAY.

10
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:56,369
SHE'S SO CUTE, AS ALWAYS.

11
00:00:59,914 --> 00:01:06,754
YOU USED TO DATE MIYAUCHI, RIGHT?

12
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:14,345
CLOSED

13
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:17,390
I'm glad your sister was all right.

14
00:01:17,473 --> 00:01:18,433
Me too.

15
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:19,684
You were a lifesaver. Thanks.

16
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:22,478
No worries.
It was just our regulars, anyway.

17
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,232
I guess you can run this restaurant
without me now.

18
00:01:26,316 --> 00:01:28,109
No, no, I can't.

19
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:29,652
I was panicking.

20
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:36,075
- Shige…
- Huh?

21
00:01:36,826 --> 00:01:39,913
Thank you for the other day.

22
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:45,627
I appreciate you taking me to the market.

23
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,254
It cheered me up.

24
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:49,380
Yeah?

25
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:52,342
Well, I'll ask for your help again.

26
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:53,760
- Of course.
- Okay.

27
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:56,262
I'll get it.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,974
Hello, this is Tanomi.

29
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:03,311
I'm very sorry this is so sudden.

30
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:05,813
Thank you very much.

31
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:08,358
Then I will visit before you open.

32
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:10,151
Thank you very much.

33
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:14,280
Miyauchi, are you open tomorrow at 17:00?

34
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:16,074
I have one appointment.

35
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:18,534
I'm going to propose the idea
for the reception.

36
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:21,412
I might not make it in time.

37
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:22,580
Okay.

38
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:24,666
I'll give them an overview
while we're waiting.

39
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,001
What's the place called?

40
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,837
Tanomi. I sent you a link.

41
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:34,467
All right.
I'll head there as soon as I'm done.

42
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,222
I took a look at your revised file.

43
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:43,559
Separately,
each piece looks somewhat passable.

44
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:47,105
But as a whole,
it seemed incohesive to me.

45
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:50,024
Incohesive?

46
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:54,278
Can it be that you don't have
a clear picture of the general theme?

47
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:58,282
What is the message
you want to convey through this piece?

48
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:02,370
RISING BUBBLES,
BUBBLES DISAPPEAR INTO UNDERWATER WORLD

49
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:03,705
UMEBOSHI CORALS SWAYING IN THE CURRENT

50
00:03:03,788 --> 00:03:07,542
The cultural festival is your chance
to promote your work before you graduate.

51
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:09,711
So try to work on it a little bit more.

52
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:14,257
Okay. I'll think about it.

53
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:30,982
OVERVIEW OF RECEPTION FOR CLIENTS

54
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:32,442
We're holding a reception

55
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:35,987
for our authors
and those we want to show appreciation to.

56
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,699
I believe our guests
would be thrilled if we could

57
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:41,659
cater from your restaurant and serve

58
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:44,704
the delicious food
that I always eat at Tanomi.

59
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:45,788
I see…

60
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:47,957
I appreciate it.

61
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,169
It's an honor coming from you, Ms. Ishida.

62
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:54,505
But we don't have
any experience in catering.

63
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:59,344
Plus, this is our regular working day.

64
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:03,097
Taiga, what do you think about this?

65
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:04,182
Huh?

66
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:08,019
I have done something like a soup kitchen

67
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:10,646
when I went to training camp for my club.

68
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:15,193
If we prepare for it well,
I don't think it will be impossible.

69
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:20,740
All right then, Ms. Ishida.

70
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:24,786
This is Hase, by the way.
How about we put him in charge?

71
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,955
Of course, I will oversee it with him too.

72
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:29,290
That's perfect.

73
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:31,876
Okay, it's settled then.
Is that okay, Taiga?

74
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:35,254
Yes. I look forward to working with you.

75
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:36,631
Thank you!

76
00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:38,091
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

77
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:41,135
I'm sorry I'm late.

78
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:45,723
This is Miyauchi,
the one in charge of this event.

79
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:46,641
Okay.

80
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:51,396
Taiga?

81
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:54,482
- What?
- You know each other?

82
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:57,110
Oh, we went to college together.

83
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:58,444
Oh yeah?

84
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,072
Excuse me.

85
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:04,617
- My name is Miyauchi Masumi.
- Hello.

86
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:07,036
We will be in your care.

87
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,455
I look forward to working with you.

88
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:12,291
Well then, that makes things easier.

89
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,418
- True.
- Hello.

90
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:14,544
- Yeah.
- Hello.

91
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:16,129
We'll be in your care.

92
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:26,490
A publishing company's party, huh?

93
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:28,409
That sounds cool.

94
00:06:28,492 --> 00:06:29,535
Thanks.

95
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:31,787
She's our regular customer,

96
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:34,790
and Shige said
that he'll leave it up to me,

97
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:36,542
so I want to give it my all.

98
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:38,502
I see.

99
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:41,088
It might be a lot of work,
but do your best.

100
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:43,216
Thanks.

101
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:45,927
About the menu…

102
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:48,054
Aside from the light refreshments,

103
00:06:48,137 --> 00:06:50,848
I'm thinking about serving
a nutritious, warm soup.

104
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,936
What about dak gomtang?

105
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,104
Dak gomtang?

106
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:05,154
This might be easy to eat.

107
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,781
Interesting…

108
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:09,700
ENERGIZE YOURSELF
WITH THE CHICKEN SOUP - DAK GOMTANG

109
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:11,786
RECIPE - TWO TO THREE SERVINGS

110
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:13,621
This is great.

111
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:15,248
Thank you, Rin.

112
00:07:15,748 --> 00:07:17,291
I need to work hard too.

113
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:26,759
Are you working on your piece
for the cultural festival?

114
00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:28,886
Yeah.

115
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,056
But I'm kind of having
a difficult time with it.

116
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:33,808
I see…

117
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:37,186
I wish I could do something to help.

118
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:38,563
SALMON FILLETS PEEK OUT

119
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:39,897
I'm hungry.

120
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:43,609
Baegopa?

121
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:48,823
I'm hungry.

122
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:53,494
That's it.

123
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,330
Something I can do for you.

124
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:03,129
Onigiri.

125
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:05,506
Yay!

126
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:10,261
Let me see…

127
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:20,146
A lot of people are going to be there
at your cultural festival, right?

128
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:21,147
Yeah.

129
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:24,567
I guess professional artists
are going to be there too.

130
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:28,738
Apparently, the cultural festival has
opened up opportunities for many people.

131
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:30,865
I see.

132
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:35,578
So in order to achieve
some kind of success before graduation,

133
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:38,247
this piece I'm working on
is really important.

134
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:41,292
Graduation…

135
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:59,518
I'm sure you'll be able to find
the answer you're looking for.

136
00:09:02,772 --> 00:09:03,856
Yeah…

137
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:10,780
Okay, it's ready.

138
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:21,248
Thank you for the food.

139
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:22,291
Enjoy.

140
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:27,713
It's warm. It's so comforting.

141
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:39,016
If I find a job in Japan,

142
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,435
I might be able to be with you longer.

143
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,981
What?

144
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,734
What?

145
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:54,782
Forget what I said.
Oh, that reminds me. The flyer!

146
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:56,492
The flyer…

147
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:57,868
There it is.

148
00:09:58,494 --> 00:10:00,830
Can you post this at your restaurant?

149
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,164
Okay.

150
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:04,917
TOKYO UNIVERSITY OF FINE ARTS FESTIVAL

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,377
It's the same…

152
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,298
It's on the same day
as the event that I just told you about.

153
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:13,718
Oh…

154
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:18,389
Well, I guess
there's nothing we can do about that.

155
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:23,352
When it's complete,
show me your artwork, okay?

156
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:25,771
Okay.

157
00:11:09,815 --> 00:11:12,318
Oh my god!

158
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:14,904
I'm only 10% finished.

159
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:18,908
I just decided on my motif too.

160
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:22,536
You still have time. No need to rush.

161
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:26,332
Amane, you're already done, aren't you?

162
00:11:26,415 --> 00:11:27,416
Yeah.

163
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,376
So fast…

164
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,880
So, what are you doing after you graduate?

165
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:37,718
I got a couple of offers,
but I'm still deciding.

166
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:40,012
Mitsuki, you're going into gaming?

167
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:42,806
The job offer will be revoked
if I can't graduate, though.

168
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:47,811
Rin, you're going back to Korea, right?

169
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:51,941
Actually, I haven't really decided yet.

170
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:53,359
Really?

171
00:11:53,943 --> 00:11:58,739
I wonder if it's too late
to find a way to stay in Japan?

172
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:03,160
Try going to Career Services.
You can get a consultation.

173
00:12:04,495 --> 00:12:06,497
- Thanks. I'll try going.
- Yeah.

174
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,962
In your case,
it will be important to find a company

175
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:15,464
that will support your visa application.

176
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:18,592
Are there any job listings
for animation companies?

177
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:20,594
Check that bulletin board over there.

178
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,223
Those are all listings
catering to international students.

179
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:26,058
JOB LISTINGS FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS

180
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,824
JOB OPENING

181
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,452
Are you proposing
to Onigiri Man or something?

182
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:49,039
No, I'm not. Where did that come from?

183
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:53,002
Why are you looking for a job in Japan?

184
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:55,004
Because you want to be with him, right?

185
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:59,133
Or what? Do you seriously
just want to work over there?

186
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,553
Well…

187
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,348
At this rate,
I'll end up listening to my mom

188
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,726
and giving up on my dream.

189
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:12,104
Let me ask you this.

190
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:14,940
What is the most important to you?

191
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:16,358
Animation?

192
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:17,568
Onigiri Man?

193
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:19,153
Your mom?

194
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:21,447
I can't answer that so suddenly…

195
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:28,662
I don't know. They're all important.

196
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:34,168
Sorry. I have to attend a meeting now.
Talk to you later.

197
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:35,085
LEE YUNGYEOL EXITED THE ROOM

198
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:36,086
Hey, wait…

199
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:52,603
RÉSUMÉ

200
00:13:57,983 --> 00:14:02,154
It's nice and colorful,
and each bite leaves you satisfied.

201
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:04,198
Thank you.

202
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:06,367
This daikon can use

203
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:09,995
a little more salt
if you want it to stay fresh longer.

204
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:12,373
Okay.

205
00:14:12,456 --> 00:14:15,167
All right, that is all the input I have.

206
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,545
Can I use the kitchen a little bit longer?

207
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:20,339
Sure, but don't wear yourself out.

208
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:23,759
I have to go too.
What about you, Miyauchi?

209
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:27,513
I want to go over the logistics with him.

210
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,306
Well then, goodbye.

211
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,141
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

212
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:35,688
First of all, let's talk about the venue.

213
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:37,648
Okay.

214
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:44,863
Okay, this is too awkward.

215
00:14:47,491 --> 00:14:48,659
I agree.

216
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:50,911
Who would have thought I'd meet you here?

217
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:52,830
- What a surprise.
- Yeah.

218
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:56,083
Well, since this is for work,

219
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,794
let's not walk on eggshells
around each other.

220
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:01,463
- Okay. Thanks.
- Okay.

221
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:05,050
So about the layout
for the day of the event…

222
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:05,968
‪Yeah?

223
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:09,555
I'm thinking of putting a table here
where you can cook.

224
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:13,976
- This is just a suggestion, but…
- Yeah?

225
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:16,603
Is there space for a portable stove?

226
00:15:18,063 --> 00:15:19,440
All right.

227
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:21,608
What do you think?

228
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:34,538
What in the world… This is great.

229
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:38,792
Wow, thanks.

230
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:41,628
Want to eat lunch?

231
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:43,380
Yeah.

232
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:45,841
Japanese sake…

233
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:48,510
Oh, where's Taiga today?

234
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:51,472
What?
Oh, I had him pick things up at the store.

235
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,974
That reminds me.

236
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:58,395
- He told me to give this to you, Noa.
- Huh?

237
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,480
TOKYO UNIVERSITY OF FINE ARTS FESTIVAL

238
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:00,439
What's this?

239
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:03,025
Rin's school is having
a cultural festival, apparently.

240
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:06,403
Now he's even advertising for her, huh?

241
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,322
KAPPABASHI DOUGUGAI STREET

242
00:16:23,754 --> 00:16:25,672
Wow…

243
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:28,509
There it is.

244
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:37,810
What's this?

245
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:46,777
How are you, Rin?

246
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:53,450
Who is that old man? Where are you?

247
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:55,035
Kappabashi.

248
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:58,872
It's a place where they sell
a bunch of kitchenware and tableware.

249
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:01,125
It's my first time coming here.

250
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:05,045
There's something similar in Korea.

251
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:07,798
It's called Hwanghak-dong.

252
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:10,884
They sell frying pans
and glassware and stuff.

253
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:13,011
Oh yeah? Hwanghak-dong?

254
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:16,807
If you're ever there, show it to me.

255
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:18,934
Show you Hwanghak-dong?

256
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:21,687
Sure.

257
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:29,528
No matter where you go,

258
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:34,283
let's share what we're seeing,
just like we are now, and go on dates.

259
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:37,327
What?

260
00:17:38,162 --> 00:17:41,582
There's no time difference,
so we can talk to each other anytime.

261
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:49,923
If both of us try our best,
even if we're far apart,

262
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:52,509
I don't think we'll be lonely.

263
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,011
- I know, right?
- Yeah!

264
00:17:54,094 --> 00:17:56,638
- I'm wearing print on print.
- That's too much!

265
00:17:56,722 --> 00:18:00,142
Sorry, you have class, huh?
I'll call you tonight.

266
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:01,476
Okay.

267
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:11,570
You don't care if we're far apart, do you?

268
00:18:18,285 --> 00:18:21,997
JUN-HO - DID YOU EAT ALREADY?

269
00:18:23,957 --> 00:18:25,292
"No matter where I go"?

270
00:18:26,293 --> 00:18:28,587
Why is he assuming that I'm going away?

271
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:31,381
You're an international student…

272
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:37,221
I know, but doesn't he want to be with me?

273
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:42,726
He can't just tell you to stay in Japan.
That would be irresponsible.

274
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:48,982
I'm not talking about responsibility.

275
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:52,110
I just want to know how Taiga truly feels.

276
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:04,456
I know.
Taiga is an honest and sincere guy.

277
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:09,378
He's not the type
to thoughtlessly say things like that.

278
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:12,422
But still…

279
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:16,927
Rin.

280
00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:22,140
Right now, the most important thing
is to think about what you want

281
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:23,809
to do with your future, right?

282
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:25,394
You can think about him after that.

283
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:32,025
You came to Japan
to study animation, right?

284
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:35,570
‪Right…

285
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,034
Well then, do your best.

286
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:44,538
I'm looking forward
to your cultural festival, too.

287
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:47,416
For now, focus on your artwork.

288
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,294
Okay?

289
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:53,797
You're right.

290
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:57,968
I should be focusing
on what's in front of me first.

291
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:04,474
Master, I am deeply grateful.

292
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,520
Is that so?

293
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:10,731
Should you need more assistance,
you may ask me.

294
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,505
- Taiga.
- Huh?

295
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:40,302
The cooking space
that I was talking about…

296
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:47,851
10 MINUTES - GAMEY

297
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:49,936
20 MINUTES - NOT GAMEY - NOT ENOUGH COLOR

298
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,938
30 MINUTES

299
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:16,963
UPLOAD COMPLETE

300
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:33,730
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

301
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:35,774
- Hello.
- Hello.

302
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:38,610
- Here you go.
- We have postcards here.

303
00:21:38,693 --> 00:21:40,779
- Please take a look.
- Enjoy.

304
00:21:58,588 --> 00:22:03,135
TAIGA - I'M SORRY I CAN'T GO TODAY
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT

305
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:17,441
Mr. Hase.

306
00:22:17,941 --> 00:22:20,235
It's almost time.

307
00:22:20,318 --> 00:22:21,778
We'll be in your care.

308
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:23,947
Yes.

309
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:29,661
RECEPTION - MEIYOSHA

310
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:33,957
Noa, you're off work?

311
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,918
Yes, I forgot to add another shift.

312
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:46,386
HOW IS IT GOING TODAY?

313
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:51,474
AKINORI - IN LINE AT THE PACHINKO PARLOR
MIGHT NEED YOU LATER

00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:01,943
TOKYO UNIVERSITY OF FINE ARTS FESTIVAL

315
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:05,822
I redrew the moment
the character falls, over and over again,

316
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,658
and adjusted the timing
until the very last minute.

317
00:23:08,742 --> 00:23:11,286
So when I heard the audience laugh,
I felt very happy.

318
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:13,997
Your experimentation with the timing
really paid off.

319
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,002
Well then, please give her
another round of applause.

320
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:29,554
Next up, is Ms. Park Rin.

321
00:23:33,642 --> 00:23:34,976
You can do it, Rin!

322
00:23:46,404 --> 00:23:49,532
I am Park Rin, a second-year
in the Department of Animation.

323
00:23:50,116 --> 00:23:52,744
The title is Onigiri.

324
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:55,121
I hope you enjoy it.

325
00:23:55,997 --> 00:23:57,832
Thank you for watching.

00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:15,934
ONIGIRI - PARK RIN

328
00:25:33,386 --> 00:25:35,096
Where do you want to go?

329
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,890
I want to go see

330
00:25:36,973 --> 00:25:38,892
- that pretty blue artwork.
- Me too.

331
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:52,447
ONIGIRI

332
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,656
Noa?

333
00:25:57,619 --> 00:25:58,453
Hello.

334
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:01,164
I didn't know you came.

335
00:26:02,248 --> 00:26:05,168
I got a flyer at Tanomi.

336
00:26:05,251 --> 00:26:06,586
And I had time, so…

337
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:09,547
What did you think?

338
00:26:12,717 --> 00:26:17,806
Well, it's so different from
the world that I live in.

339
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:19,641
So it was new and exciting.

340
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:25,855
Is she your friend?

341
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:31,152
She's Noa,
a regular at Taiga's restaurant.

342
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:33,738
Hello.

343
00:26:34,531 --> 00:26:35,740
I'm Rin's senior from college.

344
00:26:36,324 --> 00:26:37,492
Kang Jun-ho.

345
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:43,915
We have to celebrate tonight,
since you worked so hard.

346
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:46,668
Want to come too, Noa?

347
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:49,629
No, it's okay. I have to go to work.

348
00:26:51,673 --> 00:26:53,007
I'm sorry.

349
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:55,427
I promised to meet Taiga today.

350
00:26:56,219 --> 00:26:57,387
Promised?

351
00:26:58,221 --> 00:27:00,223
We're going to have
an afterparty together.

352
00:27:03,768 --> 00:27:06,604
I see. Another time, then.

353
00:27:08,314 --> 00:27:09,566
Thank you.

354
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:10,900
- Thank you.
- Hello.

355
00:27:10,984 --> 00:27:12,527
Thank you.

356
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,655
Hello.

357
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:31,087
- Even the background is calculated.
- What artists have inspired you?

358
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:33,047
I wasn't inspired by anyone.

359
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:35,508
I imagined everything in my mind.

360
00:27:35,592 --> 00:27:37,218
- Of course.
- Amazing.

361
00:27:37,302 --> 00:27:39,596
I bet all the studios want you.

362
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,973
I've never seen a student
with this much talent.

363
00:27:42,056 --> 00:27:43,600
- I agree.
- True.

364
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:45,977
She's amazing.

365
00:27:46,936 --> 00:27:48,313
Ms. Park Rin?

366
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:50,815
Yes?

367
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:53,985
I saw your film.

368
00:27:54,068 --> 00:27:55,570
It was very interesting.

369
00:27:58,448 --> 00:27:59,991
Thank you very much.

370
00:28:00,074 --> 00:28:03,995
You have a very unique perspective.

371
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:07,707
Also, the characters were very cute.

372
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:11,961
You like Onigiri?

373
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:14,881
Yes, I do.

374
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:16,799
I see.

375
00:28:18,676 --> 00:28:23,640
I've posted my past works
on my social media.

376
00:28:23,723 --> 00:28:24,641
If you'd like…

377
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:26,601
Thank you. I'll take a look at them.

378
00:28:35,735 --> 00:28:36,903
Thank you.

379
00:28:45,203 --> 00:28:46,162
Here you go.

380
00:28:49,707 --> 00:28:50,959
This is so good.

381
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:53,461
Soup really hits the spot
at these kinds of events.

382
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:57,590
It's such a comforting and warm flavor.

383
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:02,345
- I came back for seconds.
- Thank you.

384
00:29:03,513 --> 00:29:05,056
This is really good.

385
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:06,266
Yes.

386
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:08,268
- It's called dak gomtang.
- Oh I see.

387
00:29:11,145 --> 00:29:13,773
- Want to sing together?
- Really? I'd love that!

388
00:29:13,857 --> 00:29:14,983
I'd love that!

389
00:29:17,318 --> 00:29:18,236
Here you go.

390
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,911
Jun-ho, are you Rin's ex-boyfriend
or something?

391
00:29:30,707 --> 00:29:31,583
Of course not!

392
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:36,921
If I was her ex,
I would never go to see her like that.

393
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:40,174
Really? What's the big deal?

394
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:41,759
It's unacceptable

395
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:46,055
to hang out with your ex
when you're dating someone new.

396
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:48,808
Interesting…

397
00:29:48,892 --> 00:29:50,351
You're pretty strict, huh?

398
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:54,355
When you're dating,
trust is everything, after all.

399
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,276
Trust, huh?

400
00:30:00,528 --> 00:30:02,113
Noa…

401
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:06,242
Why aren't you checking your phone?
I was on a roll today, you know?

402
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:07,410
Sorry.

403
00:30:08,202 --> 00:30:09,412
Water, please.

404
00:30:13,374 --> 00:30:14,709
What's wrong?

405
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,920
Were you dumped by a girl or something?

406
00:30:18,546 --> 00:30:20,131
- Here.
- Thanks.

407
00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:21,174
Oh?

408
00:30:23,134 --> 00:30:24,636
You're the one from the other day…

409
00:30:29,557 --> 00:30:30,391
You know each other?

410
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:32,477
Cheers!

411
00:30:38,232 --> 00:30:39,442
That's good.

412
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:41,069
I see.

413
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,447
So hyeongnim means older brother?

414
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,284
Even if it's not your real brother,
you can use it for good friends.

415
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:49,827
Interesting.

416
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:52,830
I love that.

417
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:55,792
I'm an only child, after all.

418
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:59,295
If only I had an older brother like you…

419
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:01,089
I can only wish.

420
00:31:04,425 --> 00:31:05,718
What are you saying?

421
00:31:05,802 --> 00:31:07,887
We had drinks together,
so we're basically brothers.

422
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:12,475
Hyeongnim! I'll be in your care!

423
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:16,187
I'm happy to have
a dongsaeng in Japan now.

424
00:31:18,147 --> 00:31:20,108
- Hyeongnim!
- Dongsaeng!

425
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,160
- Did you really--
- So good!

426
00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:34,664
Your cooking is the best!

427
00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:36,332
It was so delicious!

428
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:38,751
Thank you.

429
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:42,922
The party was a success, huh?
That's great.

430
00:31:45,174 --> 00:31:49,387
There's a lot I need to improve on,
but I felt a strong sense of fulfillment.

431
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:52,140
What does "fulfillment" mean again?

432
00:31:53,182 --> 00:31:54,183
Um…

433
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:57,353
Like a feeling of accomplishment.

434
00:31:58,104 --> 00:32:02,525
The excitement you feel when you
succeed in doing what you needed to do.

435
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:10,199
Rin, you're the amazing one.
I can't believe you made this.

436
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:17,540
My classmate was getting
a lot more recognition.

437
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,876
But…

438
00:32:21,544 --> 00:32:24,213
I put in everything
that I could right now.

439
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:27,633
That's why…

440
00:32:28,634 --> 00:32:31,054
I will pat myself on the back for now.

441
00:32:33,014 --> 00:32:34,724
- That's right.
- Yup.

442
00:32:41,355 --> 00:32:43,066
I thought about it…

443
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:46,069
Just like you said,

444
00:32:47,028 --> 00:32:50,948
if we try our best to share
everything with each other,

445
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:56,871
we won't be lonely
even if we're far apart…

446
00:32:58,122 --> 00:32:59,582
I think.

447
00:33:13,012 --> 00:33:14,514
Yeah…

448
00:33:16,682 --> 00:33:17,558
Let's try our best.

449
00:33:25,733 --> 00:33:26,943
Rin…

450
00:33:28,027 --> 00:33:32,448
One thing on your bucket list was
"drinking ramune at a hot spring," right?

451
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:34,909
Yeah.

452
00:33:37,745 --> 00:33:42,250
Now that we're finally not so busy,
why don't we celebrate

453
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:43,960
and go on a trip?

454
00:33:44,627 --> 00:33:47,088
Let's drink ramune at a hot spring.

455
00:33:52,927 --> 00:33:54,220
I'd love that.

456
00:34:16,075 --> 00:34:19,203
Mr. Hase's food was a great hit!

457
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:21,122
- We need to work together again.
- Yes.

458
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:23,583
- Right?
- All right, let's drink tonight.

459
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,793
Oh, that reminds me.

460
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:30,756
A customer gave me
some good sake, so I chilled it.

461
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,633
Hey, Master.

462
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:35,136
Why are you trying to get me drunk?

463
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,556
Reiko, let's give this back to them.

464
00:34:39,223 --> 00:34:40,975
Tanukichi!

465
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:44,854
- Let's go home.
- I'm going home.

466
00:34:44,937 --> 00:34:46,856
- Take me.
- Thank you very much.

467
00:34:46,939 --> 00:34:49,233
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Get home safe.

468
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:58,034
TANOMI

469
00:34:58,117 --> 00:34:59,535
Up we go.

470
00:35:02,288 --> 00:35:03,289
Good work.

471
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:09,337
Masumi?

472
00:35:12,131 --> 00:35:13,341
My answer?

473
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:17,053
The art instructor position?

474
00:35:17,136 --> 00:35:18,346
Yes.

475
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:22,058
It'll be rude to make them
wait any longer.

476
00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:26,229
And plus,
you have no other options, right?

477
00:35:26,312 --> 00:35:27,521
That's not…

478
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:28,356
‪NUMAZU PORT, UCHIURA PORT
‪LOCAL FISH THAT'S IN SEASON

479
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:31,067
Please just give me a little more time.

480
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,368
TO: STUDIO JUPITET
RÉSUMÉ INCLUDED

481
00:35:54,715 --> 00:35:56,217
I sent it.

482
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:15,945
You don't have to be so on guard.

483
00:36:17,488 --> 00:36:20,741
But I guess, who wouldn't be,
if your ex-girlfriend ambushes you?

484
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:23,035
That's not it…

485
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:29,250
I wanted to apologize to you.

486
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:32,712
For saying a lot
of condescending stuff to you back then.

487
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:35,464
I'm really sorry.

488
00:36:35,548 --> 00:36:36,966
Wait, wait, what?

489
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:41,887
Back then, as in when we were dating?

490
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:43,931
Yeah.

491
00:36:45,558 --> 00:36:47,310
That was…

492
00:36:48,227 --> 00:36:50,479
my fault for dwelling on the past.

493
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:52,565
That's not true.

494
00:36:53,274 --> 00:36:55,192
I was overwhelmed myself.

495
00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:00,156
I had just started working
and all I could think about

496
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,368
was my future and "planning my life."

497
00:37:08,497 --> 00:37:09,665
But right now,

498
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:14,462
I kind of understand how you felt.

499
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,840
What?

500
00:37:19,884 --> 00:37:23,596
The thing is, I'm dating a girl right now.

501
00:37:24,513 --> 00:37:26,307
She's from Korea.

502
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:30,353
Oh yeah?

503
00:37:33,647 --> 00:37:37,026
She's planning on returning home
in a few months,

504
00:37:38,402 --> 00:37:39,612
but…

505
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:42,865
Sometimes I wonder if
I would be able to tell her

506
00:37:43,991 --> 00:37:46,869
something different
if I had a clearer vision of my future.

507
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:56,504
But I guess I just have to do my best,
one thing at a time.

508
00:38:03,886 --> 00:38:06,722
Taiga, you've changed.

509
00:38:15,689 --> 00:38:16,524
‪How?

510
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:18,776
You look old.

511
00:38:20,486 --> 00:38:21,612
‪Come on…

512
00:38:21,695 --> 00:38:24,657
- That goes for you too.
- Not at all.

513
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:37,253
Why wouldn't you turn down
a job offer from your ex-girlfriend?

514
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:39,880
I wish you would've accepted it,
even just for a second.

515
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:43,050
Sorry. I can't keep up with you.

516
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:44,009
