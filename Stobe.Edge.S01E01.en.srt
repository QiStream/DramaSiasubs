00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,760
S-Sorry.

166
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,990
I'm joking.

167
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,250
I think I've been hit enough times today.

168
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,790
See you tomorrow.

169
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,080
Yeah, see you.

170
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,130
"I've been hit enough times today"?

171
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,240
Wake up, the doors are closing.

172
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,950
Ren?

173
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,760
He was awake the whole time.

174
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,390
It's not a bad feeling at all.

175
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:14,790
Ninako, I've liked you for a long time now.

176
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:22,520
You were my anchor
when my parents were going through their divorce.

177
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,000
I've had a crush on you since then.

178
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,410
Will you go out with me?

179
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,830
I'm sorry.

180
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,410
I can't.

181
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,690
Do you have a crush on Ichinose?

182
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,240
How did you...

183
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,020
That guy has a girlfriend, you know.

184
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,560
What?

185
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,450
He's dating my older sister.

186
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,450
Has been for a while now.

187
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,040
Loving him won't get you anywhere.

188
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,840
Even if Ren has a girlfriend,
my feelings for him won't just disappear.

189
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,560
I'm such an idiot.

190
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:38,630
If only I acted sooner.
Maybe then things would've been different.

191
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,250
But I get it.

192
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,890
Just because the girl I love is crushing on another guy,

193
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,060
doesn't mean my feelings will disappear. Right?

194
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,250
Man, I can't believe myself.

195
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,480
Head on back without me.

196
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,790
I think I'll stay up here a bit longer.

197
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,250
Daiki.

198
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,540
Thank you.

199
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,950
Yeah.

200
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,200
Ninako, I sort of want to be alone right now...

201
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,800
Sayuri?

202
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,290
What, came to poke fun at the rejected guy?

203
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:08,970
You know, I thought sticking you two together

204
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,790
would finally get me to give up.

205
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,790
But I see it doesn't work that way at all.

206
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:26,660
Just because my crush loves someone else,
doesn't mean my feelings will disappear.

207
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,470
Isn't that right?

208
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,950
Huh?

209
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,220
W-Wait, what?

210
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,870
Surprised?

211
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,240
I have a crush on someone.

212
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,970
Have this seat.

213
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,450
- Thank you.
- No problem, I get off at the next stop.

214
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,330
This love of mine will never come to fruition.

215
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,970
Guess we took the same train again.

216
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,710
Looks like it.

217
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,800
I feel my chest squeeze.

218
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,450
I feel the suffocation.

219
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,410
I feel the tearfulness.

220
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,930
And I feel the pain,
like something is stabbing through my heart, too.

221
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,240
What are you smirking about?

222
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,020
Huh?

223
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,520
I wasn't smirking.

224
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,420
Don't lie, I saw you smiling.

225
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,990
Let's just say, it's nothing.

226
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,040
What's that supposed to mean?

227
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,660
Weirdo.

228
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,180
I'm glad someone like Ren...

229
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,080
is my first crush.

230
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,850
See you.

231
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:38,850
I didn't fall for him, hoping anything would come out of this.

232
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,790
I just like him.

233
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,160
And I want to tell him.

234
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,040
Ren!

235
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,660
I want him to know how happy I am to be in love.

236
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,640
That's all.

237
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,170
What's up?

238
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,290
Ren.

239
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,010
I...

240
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,330
I like you.

241
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,180
[What's in store, on STROBE EDGE]

242
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,280
Every time our eyes meet,

243
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,380
I fall for him more and more.

244
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,510
That's just so stupid.

245
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,890
What an interesting girl.

246
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,090
You can't expect anything from Ren
so long as he has a girlfriend.

247
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,290
When you have a crush like mine, it'll become obvious, Ando.

248
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,060
Doesn't it bother you that I keep crushing on Ninako?

249
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,250
You're not being fair to me right now.

250
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,230
Nothing wrong with finding a new side to yourself.

251
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,570
You're such a weirdo, Kinoshita.

252
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,830
I've discovered another reason to like him.

253
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,560
[Epilogue]

254
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,940
- Oh my gosh, isn't this so cute?
- My, it's so adorable!

255
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,000
Put that on your bag, and you'd start a trend.

256
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,510
- You think?
- Absolutely.

257
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,640
- I think I'm getting it.
- You totally should!
