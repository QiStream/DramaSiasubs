00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,954
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

2
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,724
Stop interfering and go back
to where you belong, Hong Keum-bo.

3
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,100
You did it all on purpose, didn't you?

4
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,227
You intentionally put me on the task force

5
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,645
and took those documents.

6
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,355
It's what you wanted.

7
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,818
Wait. We're on a tight schedule.

8
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,612
Don't we need a clerical assistant
for menial tasks

9
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,531
like coffee runs, copies,
and lunch delivery?

10
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,992
Please help out as much as you can.

11
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:20,872
DETAILS OF OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES

12
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,009
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

13
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,719
I've gotten in touch with
an overseas investment firm

14
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,596
that can provide short-term funding.

15
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,515
It's called DK Ventures,

16
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,308
and they'll be in Seoul for due diligence.

17
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:43,895
What if they try to assert their leverage
to strong-arm us?

18
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,271
There's no need for concern.

19
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,565
I believe this is where my role comes in.

20
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,276
I'll handle the negotiations
to ensure the terms are favorable for us.

21
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,739
All right. Excellent.

22
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,740
Come in.

23
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,498
President Shin.

24
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:08,128
Let Ms. Song know
once the investor confirms their flight.

25
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,382
We must show our special guests
the warmest hospitality.

26
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,341
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,260
I'll let her know as soon as possible.

28
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,177
Good.

29
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,566
Ms. Song.

30
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,236
Do you know why I chose to appoint

31
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,030
Shin Jung-woo as the president of Hanmin?

32
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,994
He reached out first back then.

33
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,248
I remember he sent his condolences
when President Kang passed away.

34
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,958
Condolences were just an excuse.

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,544
That's how he asserted his presence to me.

36
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,173
I was also like that when I was younger.

37
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,468
Shin has agreed to introduce us
to an investor,

38
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,220
so we must take advantage of that.

39
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,765
Sir, are you also considering
President Shin

40
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,894
as a potential son-in-law,
as Madam Choi does?

41
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,229
We'll have to see
if he's got what it takes.

42
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,024
Right.

43
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,153
About the hidden Swiss bank account
under Nora's name…

44
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:19,866
Are you certain she and her mother
are still in the dark about it?

45
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,411
You and I are the only ones
who know about that account.

46
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,412
All right.

47
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,750
It's time I bring Nora into my house.

48
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,461
A storm is coming,

49
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,256
so let us fortify the granary first.

50
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,174
All right?

51
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,390
{\an8}FOR LEASE

52
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,855
{\an8}Jeez, what is happening
to this country's economy?

53
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,649
{\an8}CLOSING NOTICE

54
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,235
{\an8}- Two orders of noodles for you.
- Thank you.

55
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,407
{\an8}I told you to go easy on Yehppee
and coax him,

56
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,742
{\an8}not finish him off.

57
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,663
{\an8}Then should I have helped them
with the hidden slush fund

58
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,623
{\an8}and shamelessly looted
the taxpayers' money?

59
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,125
{\an8}Bang Jin-mok wasn't wrong, you know.

60
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,795
{\an8}Even if the IMF crisis makes
Hanmin falter now,

61
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,172
{\an8}Chairman Kang won't be affected
in the slightest.

62
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,550
{\an8}Only the innocent employees
will suffer the hit and fallout.

63
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,511
I think Shin Jung-woo
was onto our investigation

64
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,971
and sabotaged it on purpose.

65
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,057
He knew exactly what he was doing

66
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,310
when he put me on that task force
and took the document I prepared.

67
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,021
It's still too early
to jump to conclusions.

68
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,564
If he wanted to score major points,

69
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,317
he would've simply handed you over
to Chairman Kang.

70
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,111
Who knows?

71
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,781
Shin Jung-woo might be helping you out
without you knowing,

72
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,157
just like he did in the past.

73
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,575
What do you mean?

74
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,994
When did he ever help me?

75
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,079
{\an8}Firing her for whistleblowing alone…

76
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:48,997
{\an8}9 YEARS AGO, 1988

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,456
…would be enough to send a warning

78
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,625
not just to Hong Keum-bo,
but to the whole office.

79
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,337
And if she leaks those files she has?
What then?

80
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,588
That won't happen,

81
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,090
and I'll take responsibility
if it ever does.

82
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,718
Even now, the company needs people
to do the work.

83
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,178
I'll take over…

84
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,347
the work Mr. Yun was doing.

85
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,642
Please just drop the lawsuit
against Hong Keum-bo.

86
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,980
<i>Back then,</i>

87
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,066
Shin Jung-woo ran around
as if his life depended on it

88
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,444
to stop your old firm
from pursuing a retaliatory lawsuit.

89
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,989
Why the hell didn't you tell me sooner?

90
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,075
That scared me.

91
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,244
Don't get mad at me.

92
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,000
What if you had known sooner?
Would that have changed anything?

93
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,880
I guess deep down you still have

94
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,507
at least a spoonful of hope left for him.

95
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,218
Hope, my ass.

96
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,137
Why would he bother to help me?

97
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,972
He's about to marry into the Kang family.

98
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,557
You think he'd walk away
from that opportunity?

99
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,226
Damn it.

100
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:53,936
You have a point.

101
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,900
Anyway, all signs point to us
ending the operation.

102
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,401
Let's wrap it up.

103
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,452
I mean,

104
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,996
you went undercover to expose

105
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,166
corruption within Hanmin's ownership
and management.

106
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:20,129
The livelihoods of its employees
aren't our responsibility.

107
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,633
Besides, we're barely
keeping our heads above water as it is.

108
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,927
They're talking about
financial reform laws and whatnot

109
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,471
and even possibly disbanding the FSS.

110
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,640
Talk of restructuring
has everyone feeling uneasy,

111
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,810
so you'll return to the office
by December 8th at the latest.

112
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,439
You pay for that.

113
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,875
Amid the worst economic crisis in history,
stock prices have hit a ten-year low.

114
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,627
<i>Banks and securities firms</i>

115
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,506
<i>are being hit by waves of withdrawals</i>
<i>and intense client backlash.</i>

116
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,135
<i>Clients hoping to withdraw their funds</i>
<i>have been gathering in droves</i>

117
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,637
<i>at these financial institutions,</i>
<i>even before business hours.</i>

118
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,437
CRIMINAL COMPLAINT:
FRAUD

119
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,566
{\an8}DEFENDANT: KIM MI-SOOK

120
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,111
{\an8}THE COMPLAINANT SEEKS DAMAGES
FOR FINANCIAL LOSSES…

121
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,746
Did you hear?

122
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,081
The branch manager's playing dumb again.

123
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,958
Even the head office made it clear

124
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,669
that the employees are responsible
for the funds they sold.

125
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,297
At our branch,
Kim Mi-sook is in the most trouble.

126
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,174
I hear she even received
a criminal complaint.

127
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,758
How could she possibly
compensate them all?

128
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,718
She's done for.

129
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,220
At least she's a single woman
without kids.

130
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,431
You know those debts can be passed down.

131
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,267
I know, right?

132
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,874
I knew it.

133
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,626
I clearly have an eye for these things.

134
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,504
Let's accentuate that waist a bit more.

135
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,677
Mom, I just snuck out briefly
during my lunch break.

136
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,597
I told you earlier, right?

137
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,599
My daughter's being trained as an heiress.

138
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,977
We should start bride lessons soon too.

139
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,437
Oh, right.

140
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,106
Nora, let's move you into Dad's place
as soon as possible.

141
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,236
Your dad gave a special order
for you to move in.

142
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,113
Albert has been living it up

143
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,033
in your dad's palace of a house
all this time,

144
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,496
while you've been crammed into
that shoebox with three others.

145
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,289
It upsets me so much.

146
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,833
There are five of us, not four.

147
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,336
What? Five?

148
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,754
What? It's nothing.

149
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,466
I think we should
lower the shoulders a bit.

150
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,760
It's so pretty.

151
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:13,844
This side too.

152
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,853
<i>Hong Jang-mi is actually Hong Keum-bo,</i>

153
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,106
<i>and Hong Keum-bo works for the FSS.</i>

154
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,360
<i>The FSS was in charge of</i>
<i>investigating Hanmin's slush fund,</i>

155
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,446
<i>so did Hong Keum-bo lie her way in here</i>
<i>to dig into the slush fund?</i>

156
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,282
<i>Is that why…</i>

157
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,242
<i>Where did you get that notebook from?</i>

158
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,160
You took it from the president's office.

159
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,121
Did you take it knowing about the raid?

160
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,330
Who told you to?

161
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,373
<i>Hold on.</i>

162
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,126
<i>She even knew</i>
<i>the ledger was in the president's office.</i>

163
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,420
Hong Jang-mi, that crazy brat!

164
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,182
Jang-mi, how did you know…

165
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,436
I mean, Ms. Hong,
how did you know about the ledger?

166
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,731
Because President Kang
had offered it to me as evidence.

167
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,650
You knew my President Kang?

168
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,235
Wait.

169
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,448
But I thought he had that ledger
because he was managing the slush fund.

170
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,453
You call him <i>your</i> President Kang,
yet know nothing about him.

171
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,373
So you had no shame
about wanting to steal that money

172
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,001
because you thought
he was managing the slush fund?

173
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:27,918
Hey!

174
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,670
Anyone would think that.

175
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,548
Even though he showed me
nothing but respect and kindness,

176
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,258
he was still the son of a rich chairman.

177
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,093
He and I came from different worlds.

178
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:40,139
President Kang Myeong-hwi
wished to set Hanmin on the right path,

179
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,851
although he never even got a chance
to stand up to Chairman Kang.

180
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,689
We met a few times

181
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,232
to discuss the slush fund probe.

182
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,580
Let's meet up

183
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,749
at our spot tonight.

184
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,043
All right.

185
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,592
Could it be

186
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,137
that the woman he met
the night before his accident

187
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,474
was you, Hong Keum-bo?

188
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,850
How do you know about that?

189
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,188
Ms. Song knows about it too.

190
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,650
Could she be suspecting you?

191
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,111
She did ask me
for your personnel file back then.

192
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,321
If she knew,
she would've done something by now.

193
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,239
Don't worry.

194
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,951
Anyway,

195
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,161
I'm quitting
in the first week of December.

196
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,788
So let's just play dumb until then.

197
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,916
We'll part ways then and live our lives.

198
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,378
I'll treat you as Queen Bee
until my last day.

199
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,923
You're only saying that
because it'd hurt you if I dug any deeper.

200
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,384
That's bold coming from you,

201
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,386
Ms. Go Bok-hee, the habitual embezzler.

202
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,681
You should be grateful
I'm letting you off the hook.

203
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,391
I'm not an embezzler!

204
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,936
Strictly speaking, I've never been
caught or arrested for such crimes.

205
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:09,937
Why?

206
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,647
Because I only went after dirty money.

207
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,898
You must be so proud.

208
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,068
Just leave right now.

209
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,486
I'm done worrying about you.

210
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,404
Jeez!

211
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,285
Either express concern or snap at me.

212
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,744
Choose a lane, will you?

213
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,123
CRIMINAL COMPLAINT

EPISODE 9: TWO LETTERS

215
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,641
Who is it?

216
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,060
Who's there?

217
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,194
Ms. Kim, why are you at my house?

218
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,612
Sir.

219
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:06,327
The New Korea Fund clients
filed criminal complaints against me.

220
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,037
You know what happened.

221
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,414
The head office promoted it
as their flagship product,

222
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,709
and you kept pushing for us
to raise our sales figures as well.

223
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:14,835
Ms. Kim.

224
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,961
Were you doing volunteer work?

225
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:18,923
Pardon?

226
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,592
The company can't help you
with personal lawsuits.

227
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,511
Did you do it for the company's sake?

228
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,638
You did it all for yourself,

229
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,139
so don't blame me now.

230
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,017
If you feel wronged,
you should pursue legal action.

231
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,810
Sir.

232
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,479
Please help me.

233
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,356
Damn it, stop being such a pain!

234
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,234
Listen, Ms. Kim.

235
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,195
Consult a lawyer if you feel so wronged.

236
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,947
Damn it.

237
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,279
Welcome home, Auntie.

238
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,990
Bom, why are you out here alone?

239
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,575
I'm waiting for Mommy.

240
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,746
I see.

241
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,083
Should we page her?

242
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,418
Yes!

243
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,547
Let's see here.

244
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,387
<i>When you're done recording,</i>
<i>press the star or pound button…</i>

245
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,889
Press "8282."

00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,141

247
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,395
We just told her to hurry home.

248
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,487
Once your mom gets home,
you have to go sleep in the room.

249
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,166
Things must be hectic
at the branch right now.

250
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,793
It must be tough on you as well.

251
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,969
I should've known better.

252
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,222
I put in all that effort for nothing.

253
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,137
I'm going back to work.

254
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,098
I can't put this off anymore.

255
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,818
See you.

Is this the Magang Branch?

267
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,524
I'm not a client,
but Ms. Kim Mi-sook's roommate.

268
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,528
She didn't show up to work today?

269
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,493
Hello?

270
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,786
<i>Is this Ms. Hong Jang-mi?</i>

271
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,621
<i>Do you know a Ms. Kim Mi-sook?</i>

272
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,040
Who's calling?

273

<i>Ms. Kim attempted to take her own life,</i>

274
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,008
<i>and she left behind a suicide note</i>
<i>addressed to you at the scene.</i>

275

<i>She left two suicide notes,</i>
<i>one addressed to you</i>

<i>and one addressed to</i>
<i>Chairman Kang of Hanmin.</i>

277
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,654
She left behind a letter
for Chairman Kang Pil-beom?

278
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,073
What did it say?

279
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,659
It sounds like she felt wronged
by all the pressure at work.

280
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,370
Since the IMF crisis began,
a lot of laid-off workers

281
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,205
have fallen into such incidents.

282
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,499
Since the investigation is still ongoing,

283
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,793
we had to review the contents
of the suicide notes.

284
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,399

<i>I could think of was you, Jang-mi.</i>

287
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,463
{\an8}<i>Nine years ago,</i>

288
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,883
{\an8}<i>when I was still a high school senior,</i>
<i>I started my first job</i>

00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,927
<i>at Cheongsan Accounting Firm.</i>

290
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,095
Ms. Kim, get us some coffee.

291
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,721
Yes, sir.

292
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,681
<i>I was thrilled to work</i>
<i>at such a big company,</i>

293
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,558
<i>but I felt</i>
<i>just as much pressure to do well.</i>

294
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,061
<i>I found myself constantly on edge at work.</i>

295
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,063
<i>One day, those nerves got so bad</i>

296
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,315
<i>that I spilled coffee</i>
<i>on an accountant's documents.</i>

297
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,233
I'm so sorry!

298
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,995
I'm terribly sorry.

299
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,205
You should apologize

300
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,541
for interrupting my work,
not for spilling coffee.

301
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,793
<i>I wonder if you remember telling me that.</i>

302
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,087
Way to call her out.

303
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:43,922
You can go.

304
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,015
<i>To this day, I vividly remember</i>
<i>how you told off my boss,</i>

305
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,060
<i>who was harassing me</i>
<i>in the emergency stairwell.</i>

306
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,688
Sir, why did you ask to see me?

307
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,190
You're free this weekend, right?

308
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,486
Sir, as I told you last time,

309
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,446
I'm not looking to date anyone
at the moment.

310
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,366
Hey.

311
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,953
Being young is nothing special.
Stop playing hard to get already.

312
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:19,166
Besides, I know you're just working here
to snag yourself a decent man.

313
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,252
- That's not true.
- Don't lie to me. Listen, Ms. Kim--

314
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,796
- Please don't do this.
- It's just dinner.

315
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,881
Let me treat you to--

316
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,258
What the…

317
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,635
What the hell?

318
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,345
Come on now, you know me.

319
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,181
I'm Hong Keum-bo,
the one who calls people out.

320
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,018
Are you crazy?
Is that any way to treat your senior?

321
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,187
If you're a senior, act your damn age.

322
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,938
You just sent out
your wedding invitations.

323
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,858
No decent human being would hit on
a high school girl 12 years his junior.

324
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,777
If you ever bother her again,

325
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,780
I will do everything in my power
to end you…

326
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,784
both physically and socially.

327
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,370
I can't believe this. Damn it.

328
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,290
Are you okay?

329
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,836
Why are you crying?

330
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,255
Because I'm so embarrassed.

331
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,441
She reported Hanmin for accounting fraud,

332
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,277
but their countersuit ruined her.

333
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,696
- How naive.
- Seriously.

334
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,908
Wait, my wallet.

335
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,704
I left my wallet in the office.

336
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,251
It's past 2 p.m., so you
no longer have access to the office.

337
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,502
Please follow the company rules.

338
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,965
You can't ask me to follow the rules
when I don't even work here anymore.

339
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:50,966
You can't go back.

340
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,009
I said you can't!

341
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,896
<i>Nine years have passed,</i>

342
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,524
<i>but I never stopped looking up to you.</i>

343
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,734
You left your wallet behind.

344
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,280
Thank you.

345
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,284
<i>I couldn't be of any help to you</i>

346
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,703
<i>when you were</i>
<i>wrongfully forced to leave the company.</i>

347
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,329
<i>But this time,</i>

348
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,248
<i>I was determined to protect you.</i>

349
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:25,750
Hello.

350
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:27,794
Room 301?

351
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,297
- Hello.
- Hi.

352
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,758
I'm Room 301 too.

353
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,219
<i>On the day we moved into the dorms,</i>

354
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,221
<i>you had a different name,</i>

355
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,682
<i>but I still recognized you.</i>

356
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,227
<i>I was sure you had your reasons.</i>

357
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,730
<i>I didn't want to interfere.</i>

358
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,026
Bom, do you enjoy
living with the aunties and me?

359
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,402
Yes, I do!

360
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,490
Bom, who's your favorite auntie?

361
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,617
Auntie Jang-mi.

362
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,375
I like that auntie too.

363
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:14,049
<i>Thank you for welcoming Bom into your life</i>
<i>and taking such good care of her.</i>

364
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,634
<i>One morning,</i>

365
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,472
<i>Bom showed off the dollhouse</i>
<i>she made with you.</i>

366
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,850
<i>She held up five fingers</i>
<i>and proudly said to me,</i>

367
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,729
<i>"We are a family of five."</i>

368
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:34,611
<i>I worked hard because I wanted to find</i>
<i>a place for Bom and me.</i>

369
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,739
<i>I can't burden her with my debt.</i>

370
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,784
<i>After I'm gone,</i>

371
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,995
<i>please help her renounce her inheritance.</i>

372
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,709
<i>And please tell her</i>
<i>that her mommy loves her very much.</i>

373
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,590
<i>I hope the letter I wrote to the chairman</i>
<i>finds its way to him,</i>

374
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:58,927
<i>and that he's able to rectify</i>
<i>the situation with the clients.</i>

375
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,517
<i>Please forgive me</i>
<i>for making such difficult requests.</i>

376
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,852
<i>But still,</i>

377
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,063
<i>I'm glad I got to meet you again,</i>

378
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,106
<i>Keum-bo.</i>

379
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,538
Mi-sook.

380
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,165
She's still unconscious.

381
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,918
Mi-sook…

382
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,339
She's still unconscious. Leave her alone!

383
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,134
Why are you yelling at me?

384
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,512
Why am I yelling at you?

385
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,264
Mi-sook sold those funds

386
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,599
because the head office
pressured her for sales, no?

387
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,310
Excuse me.

388
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,104
Can you three keep it down?

389
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,022
Sorry.

390
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,900
That has nothing to do with Eun-joo.

391
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,027
It most certainly does.

392
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,612
You tell her, Kang Nora.

393
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,619
Kang Nora?

394
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,372
You knew, Queen Bee?

395
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,832
Of course I did.

396
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,043
I only catered to you
because of your lofty title.

397
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,713
Mi-sook ended up like this
because of your father's orders,

398
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,298
yet you think you're blameless?

399
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,637
Hold on.

400
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,389
You're Chairman Kang Pil-beom's
only daughter,

401
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,682
Kang Nora?

402
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,352
The three of you need to leave.

403
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,104
Come on.

404
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,903
Are you really Kang Nora?

405
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,363
But I wasn't trying to hide it.

406
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,199
You never asked who my dad was.

407
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,159
Why are you in the company and the dorms?

408
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,578
My dad said if I survived
the probationary period,

409
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,789
I could have my brother's company shares.

410
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,208
His shares?

411
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,252
But Eun-joo really is my name,
from when I was younger.

412
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,254
Don't get mad, Jang-mi.

413
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,256
She's ten whole years older than you.

414
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,592
She's even older than me. She's 35!

415
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,886
Hey, why bring that up now?

416
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,179
Oh my god.

417
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,348
Hong Jang-mi, you're 35?

418
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,849
She's not Hong Jang-mi, she's Hong…

419
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,811
Sis, you should just come clean now too.

420
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,187
About what?

421
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,730
And why are you calling me that?

422
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,441
I don't recall ever having
an embezzler as a younger sister.

423
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,026
"Embezzler"?

424
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,694
I told you I'm not an embezzler!

425
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,447
What about you?
Are you proud of lying your way in?

426
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,575
If you think about it,
you're the biggest liar here.

427
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,536
Your name, age, job, and even education!

428
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,539
I saw your graduation photo
at your parents' restaurant,

429
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,748
proudly hanging on the wall.

430
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,625
When I told you

431
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,878
that it wasn't too late
for you to go to college,

432
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,340
how pathetic I must've seemed
while you laughed at me inside!

433
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,550
I did not.

434
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,137
For now,

435
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,099
you two should go back
and take care of Bom.

436
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,352
I'll stay with Mi-sook tonight.

437
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,033
DISCUSSION BOARD

438
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,327
SALES PRESSURE AT HANMIN
LEAD TO THE TRAGEDY OF MS. K AT HANMIN

439
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,453

440
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,080
AFTER CRIMINAL COMPLAINTS WERE FILED…

441
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,915
VIEW COUNT

442
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,709
HANMIN MAGANG BRANCH
FEMALE EMPLOYEE K ATTEMPTS SUICIDE

443
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,002

444
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,338
{\an8}HANMIN MAGANG BRANCH
FEMALE EMPLOYEE K ATTEMPTS SUICIDE

445
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,965
Damn it!

446
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,426
A suicide attempt?

447
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:31,306
The article seems to have been written
by a police-beat reporter

448
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,017
who managed to overhear
details of the case at the station.

449
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,019
Must we allow Hanmin

450
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,897
to be mentioned
in such a disgraceful manner?

451
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,440
What's this suicide note about?

452
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:44,193
She left one addressed to you, sir,

453
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,947
and one addressed to Hong Jang-mi,
her dormitory roommate.

454
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,659
The officer in charge of the investigation

455
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,952
delivered this yesterday.

456
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,871
Let's see.

457
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,550
<i>I am Kim Mi-sook,</i>
<i>an employee at Hanmin's Magang Branch.</i>

458
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,554
<i>The head office sent a directive</i>
<i>that raised the sales targets,</i>

459
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,432
<i>and the branch</i>
<i>reported our sales every week.</i>

460
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,935
<i>Everyone including myself at the branch</i>

461
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,438
<i>worked hard to meet the sales target</i>
<i>set by the head office.</i>

462
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,983
<i>So why is it</i>
<i>that only the branch employees</i>

463
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,277
<i>must bear the backlash from the clients?</i>

464
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,112
<i>Sir.</i>

465
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,573
<i>- Your employees deserve better.</i>
- "Your employees

466
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,701
deserve better."

467
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,748
"I hope the company takes the initiative

468
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,709
to resolve this matter."

469
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,504
Goddamn it.

470
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,263
That extreme decision was hers alone.

471
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,933
It has nothing to do with the company.

472
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:01,646
Mr. Oh, take care of the press.

473
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,022
Yes, sir.

474
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,524
I want you to make sure

475
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,360
they don't bring up our company
or the New Korea Fund.

476
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,697
And make it clear
that if they keep writing such articles,

477
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,075
they can forget about us
buying any more ad space.

478
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,202
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it.

479
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,080
Also, Ms. Song,

480
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,917
instruct the branch managers
to shred all related official documents.

481
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,795
And this roommate
she left that other suicide note for,

482
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,173
make sure
she keeps her mouth shut as well.

483
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,385
We must avoid
setting a dangerous precedent.

484
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,971
If we console them out of pity,

485
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,141
they'll only cling on and drag us down.

486
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,184
Yes, sir.

487
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,605
Besides, we must ensure
that our future partner,

488
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,316
DK Ventures,

489
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,902
forms a positive first impression of us.

490
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,489
We can't let such unpleasant news
be our introduction.

491
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,658
Don't you agree, President Shin?

492
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,870
I don't anticipate any substantial impact.

493
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,038
All right then.

494
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,624
My goodness.

495
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,926
I saw on Yeouido Pirates
that Ms. K from Magang Branch

496
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,845
even left a suicide note
for her roommates.

497
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,514
Have you heard anything from Ms. Hong?

498
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,766
I haven't.

499
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,725
I haven't either.

500
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,686
Why not?

501
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,439
How about this?

502
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,441
I'll call her to a conference room
and ask her.

503
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,110
- She came to work today.
- You're just asking for a beating.

504
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,904
I'll bet 10,000 won on a face slap.

505
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,615
She might use a fist, not an open hand.

506
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,241
- A mighty punch.
- Why you…

507
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,245
I mean, you're all curious, aren't you?

508
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,831
You're a general manager, so act like one.

509
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,126
Did you hear anything
about how the company will respond?

510
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,545
I'm sure they'll clamp down on all fronts.

511
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,505
Quietly, that is.

512
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,057
Hong Jang-mi.

513
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,559
Are you going to see Ms. Song too?

514
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,395
I'm sure it'll be about Mi-sook.

515
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,486
I hear you're roommates
with Ms. Kim Mi-sook.

516
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,614
Yes, that's right.

517
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,867
Did you write that post
on Yeouido Pirates, Ms. Go?

518
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,619
No, ma'am.

519
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,579
I would never, ma'am.

520
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,290
Was it you, Ms. Hong?

521
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,628
It wasn't you.

522
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,297
Did you call us in
to find out who leaked it?

523
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,008
Kim Mi-sook is an orphan.

524
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,846
If anyone were to leak it,
it would be the suicide note recipient

525
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,974
or her roommate in the dorms.

526
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,561
Hong Jang-mi,
she wrote you a note, didn't she?

527
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,605
Ms. Kim Mi-sook's suicide attempt

528
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,150
is undeniably the result
of work-related stress.

529
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,486
Shouldn't you ask about
how she's doing first?

530
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,281
How can the head office, the branch,

531
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,908
and even the OW Club
that the victim admired,

532
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,494
all just erase her
and pretend as if nothing happened

533
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,705
to prioritize damage control?

534
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,748
If, in any case, she'd died--

535
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,125
But she didn't die.

536
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,296
What's with this fuss
when she's still alive?

537
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,217
Just hand over the suicide note.

538
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,149
Those are the criminal complaints
filed against Hanmin's Ms. Kim Mi-sook

539
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:36,777
that demand compensatory damages
for the New Korea Funds she sold.

540
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,655
Will the company deal with the lawsuits?

541
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,824
Otherwise, at least help
with her hospital bills.

542
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,369
You have some nerve.

543
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,372
Let me apologize on her behalf, ma'am.
I'll have a talk with her.

544
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,249
She's just in a state of shock right now.

545
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,926
{\an8}HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

546
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,694
Hey, Ms. Hong.

547
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,949
You're roommates with Kim Mi-sook
from the Magang Branch, right?

548
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,742
Yes.

549
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:25,660
Come on.

550
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,787
I heard she left

551
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,206
a suicide note for the roommates.

552
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,291
Did you read it? What did it say?

553
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,337
I heard she addressed the complaints
about the company to the chairman.

554
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,423
She must've written
something else to her friends.

555
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,967
What's it to you?

556
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,343
I'm just curious.

557
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,223
- Let us in on the gossip.
- Mr. Cha.

558
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,350
What's wrong with you?

559
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,726
If the job was killing her,

560
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,687
she could've just quit.

561
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,563
Why attempt suicide?

562
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,110
Asshole!

563
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,287
What? "Asshole"?

564
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,288
Come here.

565
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,373
I can't believe this.

566
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,377
There's big trouble. Come out now!

567
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,255
What did you say?

568
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,632
Unbelievable.

569
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,468
- "Asshole"?
- Yes! Asshole!

570
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,888
Do I look like a peer to you?

571
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,142
If we were peers,
you wouldn't be standing.

572
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,977
You'd already be crushed under my feet!

573
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,645
Goddamn.

574
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,024
Can you believe this?

575
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,067
Listen.

576
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,319
You and I?

577
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,405
When it comes to rank, age, and gender,

578
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,158
you're nowhere near my level
in any respect!

579
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,162
Why you little… You damn brat!

580
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,254
Asshole.

581
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,255
What?

582
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,840
When someone younger criticizes you,

583
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:06,677
that should be a sign to reflect
on the poor choices you've made.

584
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,930
Ms. Hong, please try to calm down.

585
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,599
Don't touch me!

586
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,480
If you ever run that mouth
about Mi-sook again,

587
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,649
I will end you.

588
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,986
Damn it.

589
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,990
Damn it. Come here.

590
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,450
Hey, Hong Jang-mi!

591
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,286
- Why that little…
- Unbelievable.

592
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,245
Ms. Hong!

593
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,582
Go.

594
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:38,959
Hey!

595
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,213
Hong Jang-mi!

596
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,881
Your days are numbered here!

597
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,007
Stop it.

598
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,550
I'll make sure of it!

599
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,722
- You're so loud.
- You went too far.

600
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,266
What are you staring at? Damn it.

601
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,435
It hurts.

602
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,353
Get back to work!

603
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,106
He's so goddamn embarrassing.

604
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,149
Where did Mr. So go?

605
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,276
He's probably upset
because he's menopausal.

606
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,573
It's okay.

607
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,784
Take the next three days off,
starting today.

608
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,413
You'll leave immediately.

609
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,041
I apologize for causing…

610
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,502
such a commotion.

611
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,462
Thank you…

612
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,714
for holding back.

613
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,137
If you had actually hit him…

614
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,347
Right, you did.

615
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,766
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

616
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,437
I might not look it,
but I'm still a division manager.

617
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,527
{\an8}LETTER OF RESIGNATION

618
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,405
It's my resignation letter.

619
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,465
Why are you following me?
Go and look after Bom.

620
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,175
I have something to ask you.

621
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,969
When did you find out that I was Nora?

622
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,512
Since you joined the company.

623
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,056
Ms. Song ordered me to monitor you.

624
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,266
Ms. Song did?

625
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,894
And you agreed to do it, Queen Bee?

626
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:21,896
It was an order.

627
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,648
Besides, why am I still "Queen Bee"?

628
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,733
Hong Jang-mi…

629
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,026
No, Hong Keum…

630
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,653
Whatever her name is, she's Queen Bee now.

631
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,155
Nora.

632
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,543
Ms. Go, right?

633
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,671
I've heard a lot about you from Ms. Song.

634
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,256
Yes, ma'am.

635
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,759
Nora, let's go home now.

636
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,594
Home?

637
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,720
But this is my home.

638
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,013
What are you talking about?

639
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,932
I told you earlier.

640
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,350
You're moving into Dad's place.

641
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,477
I can't today.

642
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,773
Someone is waiting for me inside.

643
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,984
We can have the housekeeper come by
to pick up your stuff.

644
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,694
Wait, no.

645
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,947
You can pack Nora's stuff
and send it over, right?

646
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,158
Sure, ma'am.

647
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:17,910
Thank you.

648
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:18,994
Let's go.

649
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,080
It's so cold today.

650
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:25,793
Go on.

651
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:35,761
Damn it.

652
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,232
Why does she have so many clothes?

653
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,240
Those are Auntie Eun-joo's.

654
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,535
She went home. She's not coming back.

655
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,036
Then,

656
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,081
did Auntie Jang-mi go home too?

657
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,335
No.

658
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,379
She's with your mom.

659
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,266
Starting tonight,
you can sleep with me in the big room.

660
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,188
Where's Mommy?

661
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,886
Bom.

662
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,822
Why did you bring her here?

663
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,115
What did you tell her?

664
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,533
I told her it was an accident.

665
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,370
She deserves to know where her mom is.

666
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,332
We can't just leave her alone
in the dorms for the night.

667
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,542
Why would she be alone? Where's Nora?

668
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,336
She left with her mom earlier.

669
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,338
She left for good.

670
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,009
I've thought about it all day.

671
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,471
Let me see the rest of Mi-sook's letter.

672
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,889
I need to read it for myself.

673
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,146
Have you ever prayed for someone
other than yourself?

674
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,151
I didn't recognize her when we met again,

675
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,947
and I'm still not sure
I know what kind of person Mi-sook is.

676
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:46,827
But…

677
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:50,998
I do remember…

678
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,962
that she prayed for me, for us.

679
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,716
Why couldn't she just think about herself?

680
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:06,763
If…

681
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,726
If I had told her

682
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,354
that it wasn't her fault that night,

683
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,357
would she have been okay now?

684
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,448
You thought you got away with it
because you were clever, huh?

685
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,492
We let you get away with it.

686
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,911
I let you get away with it,
and so did Mi-sook.

687
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,123
I let you because I felt bad
that Go Bok-cheol attacked you,

688
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,377
but Mi-sook let you because
she's just too nice for her own good!

689
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,632
Poor Mi-sook…

690
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,268
Bom.

691
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:57,898
Bom…

692
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,401
What are we going to do?

693
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:07,658
Bom…

694
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:17,084
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

695
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,255
Hey.

696
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,134
Thank you for making the trip.

697
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,469
I'm exhausted.

698
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,638
Did you enjoy the meal we prepared?

699
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,557
- It was delicious.
- I'm glad.

00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,475
Nice to meet you. I'm Oh Deok-gyu.

701
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,686
- Yes, hello. I'm--
- Let's talk inside.

702
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,437
Sure.

703
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,237
{\an8}It's a pleasure to meet you.

704
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,406
I'm D.K. Lee of DK Ventures.

705
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,492
I am Kang Pil-beom.

706
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,580
Please take a seat.

707
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,748
Let's sit.

708
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,963
Should we get right to it then?

709
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,006
Sir.

710
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:07,384
DK Ventures wishes to dispatch
an investment due diligence team here

711
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,845
to the head office next week.

712
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,389
Before that,
I'd like to sort out a few things first.

713
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:17,311
We heard Hanmin is in urgent need of
300 billion won in operating funds.

714
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:21,815
Based on the financial statements,
some members of our board are concerned

715
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,401
about Hanmin's management soundness.

716
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,196
So we'd like management control
along with a portion of the equity.

717
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,367
Management control as well?

718
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,911
It'll benefit both parties.

719
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,246
That's not what worries me.

720
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,458
My concern is that you'll be asking
for the whole company next.

721
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:45,005
How about using
the head office building as collateral?

722
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,675
Our company does hold
a considerable amount of real estate,

723
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,218
both in land and buildings.

724
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,638
Having a mortgage against our real estate

725
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,557
could negatively affect
the company's public image.

726
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,650
My goodness…

727
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:12,157
What if Hanmin issues bonds
that DK Ventures could purchase directly?

728
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,786
If public funds are reinjected,

729
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,704
maintaining a domestically owned image

730
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,666
while avoiding the appearance
of overseas backing

731
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,334
could work in our favor.

732
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,340
Would you consider that?

733
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:31,468
I believe DK Ventures' payout

734
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,513
would certainly be ensured with that idea.

735
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,349
Okay.

736
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:38,558
It's not a bad deal.

737
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,769
And one more thing.

738
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:44,314
An organization must be lightweight
for efficient management,

739
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:48,735
but Hanmin is weighed down
by too much dead weight at the moment.

740
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,116
We'd like to request
aggressive cuts in labor costs.

741
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,076
You know,

742
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:57,744
a diet.

743
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:04,042
Cutting costs
will help balance our profit and loss.

744
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:08,004
Yes. I understand.

745
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,759
After all, a good presentation
goes a long way.

746
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,849
I knew Chairman Kang would say that.

747
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,143
He's stingy with his own,

748
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,062
but happy to rack up debt
with other people's money.

749
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:28,692
He'll issue short-term bonds
with a one-year maturity,

750
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,403
then ask to extend the repayment period
by another year or two.

751
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,031
In the meantime,
we'll quietly accumulate more bonds.

752
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,784
And if Hanmin goes bankrupt on its own?
That's a win for us.

753
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,536
<i>What if,</i>

754
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,038
in the worst-case scenario,

755
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,125
Hanmin Investment & Securities
goes bankrupt?

756
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,085
We can file
for a court-mediated debt workout

757
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,421
and request an extension
of the repayment period.

758
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:52,090
Meanwhile, your management control
would be protected.

759
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,634
<i>If he continues to hold out,</i>

760
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,263
we'll take over Hanmin
with a surprise court receivership filing

761
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,307
and spruce it up to sell it.

762
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:04,144
Then all of Yeouido
will be in the palm of our hands.

763
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:11,568
The 15th presidential election
is coming up.

764
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,363
They say the nation is in crisis,

765
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:19,868
but whoever becomes the next president
will have to stimulate the economy.

766
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,121
The IMF crisis
will last four years at most.

767
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,540
Even if all the other companies crumble,

768
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,794
we just need to hold out until then.

769
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,881
At the end of the day,
they would never dare

770
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:36,134
to go after Hanmin
with just 300 billion won.

771
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,470
That's right.

772
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,848
All right then.

773
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,645
Restructuring?

774
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:49,815
Dad, there are only four of us
in Risk Management, including me.

775
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,608
It makes it that much easier.

776
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,235
Save yourself and Bang Jin-mok,

777
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,487
and get rid of the other two.

778
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,614
I can't do that. I don't want to.

779
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,366
You know, I realized today

780
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,536
that we need to be closer
to President Shin.

781
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,371
As opinion leaders of this company,

782
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,248
we need to expand our global network.

783
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,124
Knock yourself out being global.

784
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,168
I don't want to.

785
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,711
You punk.

786
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,714
This is important stuff,
so at least pretend to listen.

787
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,632
Hey!

788
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,184
A 40% staff reduction?

789
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,437
The president summoned
all the general managers

790
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,482
and told us we had to
reduce our teams by 40 percent.

791
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,152
That overseas investor
who's lending the money

792
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,988
is strongly demanding it,

793
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,948
so there's no other choice.

794
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,576
Was that why Big Al was called in?

795
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,827
Probably.

796
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,497
I heard the division heads
have to decide and submit a layoff list.

797
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:52,377
And I guess Ms. Hong
may have heard about it sooner.

798
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,005
She already handed in her resignation.

799
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,632
That's the best news I've heard all day.

800
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,967
You're a general manager, so--

801
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,594
Right, so act like one?

802
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,511
Yeah.

An employee with 25 years of service
came to say farewell,

807
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,687
and they have him waiting for three hours?

808
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:31,494
The chairman said

809
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,081
there is no need for you
to submit your resignation letter.

810
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:39,002
Today will be
your last day of work, Mr. So.

811
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:45,633
There's something I'd like to say
to the chairman before I go.

812
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,260
You should just go.

813
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,596
You know how he is.

814
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,604
Mr. Cha,

815
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:43,399
why don't you finish up
Trading's restructuring list

816
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:44,818
for me as well?

817
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,570
Yes, sir.

818
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,572
I'll see to it immediately
and report back.

819
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,573

00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,952
What am I supposed to do there?

831
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,745
No clue.

832
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,747
What am I supposed to do in IT?

833
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,250
Why am I not on the layoff list?

ENDURE, EVEN SUFFERING CAN BE BEAUTIFUL.
WHEN HARDSHIP STRIKES, TRY SMILING.

837
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,944
Are you certain about letting go of
Mr. Bang Jin-mok and Mr. So Gyeong-dong

838
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,279
at this time?

839
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,740
It would've been another headache

840
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,492
if they'd refused to leave.

841
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:18,620
We might as well cut them loose now.

842
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,040
There will always be
younger and smarter new hires.

843
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,260
How could they get rid of Risk Management

844
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,262
when we're in the middle of
the IMF crisis?

845
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,974
And why is Mr. Bang on the layoff list?

846
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,142
I told you I was quitting.

847
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,895
Mr. Bang made me.

848
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,898
He made me write my name down
because I'll never get fired,

849
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:50,568
and then his own name
since the company's wanted him long gone.

850
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,237
Then three would survive.

851
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:58,076
I've been wanting to leave Hanmin
for a while now.

852
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,036
If I get forced out,

853
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,289
it'd only leave regrets, right?

854
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,543
Then for your farewell party,

855
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,002
we should go to your favorite--

856
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:08,920
Forget it.

857
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,881
Let me go home sober for once.

858
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,519
I didn't want to put
your name down anyway.

859
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,772

That's it.

872
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,621
At least say a few parting words.

873
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,133
Good luck.

874
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,139

875
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,184
Senior?

876
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:52,690
I'm off.

877
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:55,943
Get home safe.

878
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:27,558
SEOUL CITY DORMITORY
FOR SINGLE FEMALE WORKERS

879
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:28,518
This way.

880
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:30,728
Watch the steps.

881
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,734
Watch the steps.

882
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,740
Are they moving out of the dorms?

883
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,742
They've been laid off,

884
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,787
so they can no longer stay
in the workers' dormitory.

885
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,541
Many of them go back home
to the countryside.

886
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,374
Bom, wake up.

887
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:38,171
Let's get changed
and sleep with me in the big room.

888
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:12,997
PARK JIN-HUI

889
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,337
PARK JIN-HUI
SAENARA BANK

890
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,137
{\an8}HANMIN'S OUTSTANDING WOMEN…

891
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,189
I made those.

892
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:51,410
<i>Yehppee!</i>

893
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,791
<i>Yehppee and I</i>

894
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:59,293
<i>are getting the ledger together</i>
<i>for whistleblowing purposes.</i>

895
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:01,254
<i>You can pick up the slush fund ledger</i>

896
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:05,091
<i>at the president's office</i>
<i>on the 12th floor in Hanmin's head office.</i>

897
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,176
{\an8}QUARTERLY BUSINESS PLAN

898
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,762
- Is it not there?
- This can't be.

899
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,889
I'll find Yehppee within three months

900
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,475
and retrieve the slush fund ledger.

901
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,476
What?

902
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,770
You already know, Yehppee.

903
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,356
You have a copy
of the slush fund ledger, don't you?

904
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,774
No.

905
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:23,734
Where's that notebook?

906
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,027
The notebook with the sticker.

907
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:27,321
Sir, have you seen a notebook this big?

908
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,657
There's a dog sticker
in the bottom-right corner.

909
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,492
I burned it all up already.

910
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:33,911
See? It's all gone.

911
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,001
<i>Yehppee!</i>

912
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,742
That's an obscene amount of money.

913
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:15,286
It's three times what we estimated.

914
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:25,630
Director Yun, I found it.

915
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,465
The slush fund ledger.

916
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:41,854
Pardon me.

917
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,732
It's all right.

918
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:46,692
Oh no.

919
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,152
I hope it's okay.

920
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:49,820
It should be fine.

921
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,698
It's fine. You can go.

922
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:53,616
Bye.

923
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,335
The higher-ups have no desire
to investigate the slush fund.

924
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:06,462
They're adamant.

925
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,674
With the economy in crisis,

926
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,134
they can't afford to go after
the executives' corruption.

927
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:15,596
That's just an excuse
because they're scared.

928
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,016
If it's a national and corporate crisis,

929
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,686
the decision-makers
should take responsibility.

930
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:25,481
Why are the loyal, hard-working people
losing their jobs and suffering for it?

931
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:36,867
Damn it.

932
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,574
I wanted to see

933
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:20,202
if you were someone
who could be entrusted with a life…

934
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,622
for myself.

935
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,583
I'm talking about Hanmin's.

936
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:30,296
If we go bankrupt, thousands
of employees will be out on the streets.

937
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:31,881
Is that the justice you seek?

938
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:34,759
Why haven't you gotten anywhere,
while I've come this far?

939
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:37,928
I want to do well with this
so I can get a permanent spot next year.

940
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,889
Here's a pick-me-up treat for you.

941
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:42,558
I am Kim Mi-sook
from Hanmin's Magang Branch.

942
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,616
KIM MI-SOOK
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

943
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,129
{\an8}MOYUN HOSPITAL

944
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:25,851
Let's talk outside.

945
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:27,770
Your outfit…

946
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:29,480
Are you going somewhere?

947
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,942
Today's the day I return to the FSS.

948
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:43,911
You saw the ledger, so you know.

949
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,163
It's well over 300 billion won.

950
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:49,291
If Chairman Kang had used that slush fund,

951
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,336
the foreign funding from DK Ventures

952
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:54,130
and the restructuring
could've been avoided.

953
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:56,048
Yes, exactly.

954
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,175
I know you think I'm just some vile thief,

955
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:01,720
but compared to Chairman Kang,
I'm just a petty crook scraping by.

956
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,806
You know what's more infuriating?

957
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:06,559
Even if this country and Hanmin go under,

958
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,686
Chairman Kang's family
will remain unscathed.

959
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:13,607
The ledger being burned
was the will of the heavens,

960
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:16,318
so goodbye to you too, Ms. Hong Keum-bo.

961
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:18,737
What if it didn't burn?

962
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,747
By the will of the heavens,
it ended up in my hands.

963
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,002
Not a chance, Queen Bee.

964
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,089
You'll be laden with honors
if you return with that.

965
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:38,883
No.

966
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,134
I'm going to steal it all.

967
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:42,219
Are you in?

968
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:28,682
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

969
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:32,102
{\an8}- Goodbye now.
<i>- This country's economy is in peril.</i>

970
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,730
{\an8}<i>Nobody cares about</i>
<i>a chairman embezzling money.</i>

971
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:36,607
{\an8}<i>They're not going to pursue it!</i>

972
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:39,193
{\an8}I'm thinking about securing a position
for Ms. Kang at the company.

973
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,278
{\an8}The lowest score on the written exam?

974
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,738
{\an8}It's you? Ma'am?

975
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,907
{\an8}<i>Director Yun told you to return</i>
<i>on December 8th.</i>

976
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,700
{\an8}<i>Why are you still here?</i>

977
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,912
{\an8}<i>She's just being stubborn right now!</i>

978
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:51,789
{\an8}Steal 300 billion won and then what?

979
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:53,332
{\an8}<i>I'm not done yet.</i>

980
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,084
{\an8}Is it just me,

981
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:58,170
{\an8}or do you seem
particularly interested in Hong Jang-mi?

982
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:04,426
