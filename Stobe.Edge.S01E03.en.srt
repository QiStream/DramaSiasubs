1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,100
Ren, I like you.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,090
I'm sorry. I already have a girlfriend.

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,540
Is this your girlfriend?

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,200
Ren only looks blunt and cold. He's really kind at heart.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,760
Will you continue to be my friend regardless?

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,000
Acting like nothing's happened between you and Ninako?
No one calls that "being kind".

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,080
Doesn't it bother you that I keep crushing on Ninako?

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,500
You're not being fair to me right now.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,360
When you have a crush like mine, you'll get it.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,240
Sorry, I won't do that ever again.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,180
Don't hide from me.

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,600
I think he's gone now.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,170
Thanks.

14
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,300
Ren?

15
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,260
Ando and I will handle the rest of the work here.

16
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,070
Why did you start avoiding me?

17
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,010
If I'm annoying you, just say so.

18
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,850
Yeah, you are.

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,230
Oh, okay.

20
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,200
Then you didn't need to help me out.

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,280
You could've just left me there.

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,170
Especially if we can't be friends anymore.

23
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,540
Did you see Ninako around?

24
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,970
What did you do to her?

25
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,320
Did you bump into her?

26
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,710
Was she... okay?

27
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,130
Answer my question first.

28
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,110
I kissed her.

29
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,680
Only on the forehead though.

30
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:52,180
Didn't I tell you she's not like those other girls of yours?

31
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,980
I know she's not.

32
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,990
That's why I caught myself, and went for her forehead instead.

33
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,580
I held myself back, okay?

34
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,620
But I do regret acting rashly.

35
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,940
That Ninako Kinoshita's such an idiot.

36
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,690
Seriously, why would she stick to a guy who rejected her?

37
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,850
I know right? She definitely thinks she's special.

38
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,740
He's just playing with her heart.

39
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,150
And she totally buys it!

40
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,040
- We won't fall for his tricks though.
- Exactly.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,050
You should see yourselves when you're badmouthing people.

42
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:55,410
I don't care what you do, or say about me.

43
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,880
But could you leave Kinoshita alone?

44
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,500
I promise to keep my distance from her.

45
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,790
That's why you're avoiding me?

46
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:19,870
So those girls won't mess with me?

47
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,030
- What the...
- Let go.

48
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,180
If you want to keep pushing me around, go for it.

49
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,590
I won't bend so easily.

50
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,430
Don't let people like that ruin our friendship. That's just wrong.

51
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,230
Kinoshita.

52
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,430
You're such a weirdo.

53
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,890
I've discovered another reason to like him.

54
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,950
I'm sorry about yesterday.

55
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,470
Really, really sorry.

56
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,360
I'm feeling generous today.

57
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,060
You're forgiven.

58
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,850
Thanks. Did something good happen to you?

59
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,360
You could say that.

60
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,190
Let me guess. You made up with Ren?

61
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,010
How could you tell?

62
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,170
Because I like you.

63
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,980
That's not something you should joke about.

64
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,400
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,880
See you around.

66
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,160
- Morning.
- Big news, Ninako!

67
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,020
Sayuri and Daiki are now officially a couple!

68
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,500
Really?

69
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,540
- Congratulations!
- Congrats, you two!

70
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,430
How did that go down, Daiki?

71
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,170
This is fatally rough.

Kinoshita?

75

Ren.

76
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,030
You're studying? But midterms just ended.

77
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,980
I have to retake my math exam. I scored pretty badly.

78
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,800
Seriously? Same here.

79
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,620
I'm having Ren tutor me a bit. How about you join us?

80
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,740
Can I?

81
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,010
Sure, I don't mind.

82
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,040
- Thanks again, dude.
- Anytime.

Manabu Miyoshi of Year 1, Class 7.
Come to the committee office.

84
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,430
Shoot, I forgot about that. You two get started without me.

85
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:16,770
What happens if I fail again, even after all your help?

86
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,010
You won't. Not on my watch.

87
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,390
Are you having trouble solving that equation?

88
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:39,690
See how you have the three points of the triangle
from the previous question?

89
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,590
Now you use the Law of cosines

90
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:49,130
to figure out the "x"
in "x-squared plus x minus 12 equals 0".

91
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,950
Once you've solved that, then...

92
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,170
Wait, you've already solved the question.

93
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,020
Ren, do you like math?

94
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,260
I love it.

95
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,890
I wish I could say the same thing.

96
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,010
Oops, I forgot we were in the library.

97
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,540
You're fine. We're the only ones here right now.

98
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,130
You're like a god.

99
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,670
The sun's shining down on you, to sort of give you a halo.

100
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,190
You've seen a god before?

101
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:14,050
Sure have. The god of math is sitting in front of me right now.

102
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,760
What the heck?

103
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,170
This is when I'd wish time would slow down a bit.

104
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,160
And that's all I'd wish for.

105
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,050
Ta-da!

106
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,650
We both managed to score high!

107
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:42,160
We owe it all to your tutoring. Thank you, Ren.

108
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,500
I only helped. Your hard work is what really paid off.

109
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,950
Finally, no more study sessions.

110

That was a long week.

Welcome!

116
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,870
Working part-time at a cafe? Sounds fun!

117
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,370
I wouldn't mind helping out either.

Really? Thanks, you two!

119

You okay? Take it slow, and no need to panic.

Yes, thank you.

- Yeah.
- See you.

Why not just try again? Confess, and get shot down.

138

Maybe that will give you the closure you need.

I'm fine with keeping these feelings to myself.

You're just trying to convince yourself.

00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,550
You really think you're okay with receiving nothing in return?

143
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,380
Keep that up, and you'll eventually break down.

Why would you say that?

That's not your decision to make.

How was your first day of part-time work?

No real reason.

Yup. He was promoted from "Manager" just the other day.

At first, he was only an "Employee",
but with how he's fattened up,

166
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,380
I have to call him "Director".

167
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,320
No one's climbed the career ladder as fast as him.

168
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,870
So he's a real career cat, huh?

169
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,600
What do you call this kitty?

170
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,460
I call him "Yama the Salaryman".

171
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,310
- Then he's got a ways to go.
- I've never seen Ren act like that before.

172
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,060
Do you think Ren likes...

173
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,180
You can't assume anything, especially about stuff like that.

174
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,590
Besides, Ren has a girlfriend he cares about.

175
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,460
Don't stir the pot, and make his life more confusing.

176
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,240
Yeah, I won't.

177
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,740
Here's your lunch.

178
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,910
Thanks a million.

179
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,280
What's for lunch today?

180
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,130
Time to dig in.

181
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,010
Same here.

182
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,570
That's delicious!

183
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,410
I'm glad to hear it.

184
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,000
- Sayuri.
- Yeah?

185
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:43,020
I always appreciate you bringing lunch for me,
but doesn't it get tiring?

186
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,900
Not at all.

187
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,970
Besides, I want you to eat more than just bread every day.

188
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,160
I love you, Sayuri.

189
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,420
That came out of nowhere.

190
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,200
I just realized I never properly told you.

191
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,420
Now that I think about it,
maybe I will start bringing lunches again.

192
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,490
Why is that?

193
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,690
My dad said there's someone he wanted us to meet.

194
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,950
Probably the woman he wants to be his new wife.

195
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,180
How does that make you feel?

196
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,740
If my dad wants to get married again, I'll support him.

197
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,620
The issue is my sister.

198
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:40,380
I think she still believes the family
can be brought back together again.

199
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,450
So when I consider her feelings, I can't help but hesitate a bit.

201
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,020
Want some chocolate?

202
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,120
Take your pick.

203
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,160
Then I'll take this one.

204
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,040
What?

205
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,820
There's something nice about a guy eating sweet things.

206
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,270
Like going to a cafe, and splitting cakes with my boyfriend?

207
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,290
That's a date I dream of!

208
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,680
I imagine I'd end up scarfing down a lot more,

209
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,350
and although my boyfriend would chide me,
he'd still split his share.

210
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,470
You look like you're having fun.

211
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,140
Do you do that sort of thing with Mayuka?

212
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:07,530
Mayuka doesn't eat sweet things often because of her job.

213
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,850
So no, I suppose not.

214
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,980
I see.

215
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,290
I try not to eat sweet things around Mayuka anyway.

[Nail Color, new polish out now!]

217

I'm sorry I spoke out of line the other day.

218
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,660
This is just a small peace offering.

219
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,060
It's good.

220
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,160
Thanks.

221
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,760
Is Ren your first crush?

222
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,230
What was your first crush like?

223
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,220
- Mine?
- Yeah.

224
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,300
My first crush was...

225
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,520
a girl I dated in my second year of middle school.

226
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,620
Really? What was she like?

227
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,120
She was sly girl.

228
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,290
She only went out with me

229
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,250
to get close to this other guy she liked more.

230
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,100
We were close friends, that guy and I.

231
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,940
Don't look so upset.

232
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,110
I'm ultimately the one who's more at fault here.

233
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,110
As soon as I learned I was being used,

234
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,520
I just left her. I didn't even try to win her over.

235
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,960
I'm an awful guy, who never took girls seriously since.

236
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,300
That's why I've decided to change.

237
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,540
I want to really put in effort this time.

238
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,150
You have a crush?

239
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,940
I'm currently experiencing my second real exposure to love.

240
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,410
Wow, I had no idea.

241
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,180
Good luck.

242
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,400
You'll root for me?

243
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,740
Of course.

244
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,450
That's the most heartening thing I could hear right now.

245
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,210
We'll be heading out.

246
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,670
- Have a good one.
- See you.

247
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,010
Huh? You're already done for the day?

248
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,400
- Mayuka?
- Hello there.

249
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,600
Hello.

250
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,870
I guess I was a tad too late.

251
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,300
And here I thought I'd enjoy some tea while watching Ren work.

252
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,340
Why not drop in anyway? I hear our cakes are pretty good.

253
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,950
It's fine.

254
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,970
I'm on a diet right now, and Ren doesn't eat sweet things anyway.

255
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,560
I suppose we'll see ourselves out now.

256
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,620
You're not bothering us. Let's go somewhere, with the four of us.

257
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,020
Come on, let's go.

258
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,380
Half-and-half.

259
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,150
Smells like half autumn, half winter now.

260
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,720
What?

261
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,440
I was just thinking the same thing.

262
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,100
Ren, I just remembered there's something I wanted to talk about.

263
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,460
Could we get some time alone?

264
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,970
Sure.

265
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,000
Sorry guys, but could we split here?

266
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,790
I'm really sorry, you two.

267
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,880
It's totally fine.

268
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,690
You two lovebirds enjoy yourselves.

269
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,890
Come on, let's go.

270
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,710
Why are you getting hurt over your own words?

271
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,060
I thought you were fine keeping your feelings to yourself.

272
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,630
I get it, okay?

273
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,410
No, you don't.

274
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:06,130
You can't expect anything from Ren
so long as he has a girlfriend.

275
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,760
You don't understand the limits there are
in your relationship with him.

276
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,160
Keep this up, and you'll only continue to hurt.

277
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:21,670
I know, but there's nothing I can do about it.

278
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,780
Sometimes, you need to make an effort to move on.

279
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,180
Even if that means using someone else.

280
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,230
What?

281
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,490
Use me.

282
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,910
I'll help you forget Ren, for good.

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,550
I like you.

So try experiencing romance with me.

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,380
Why are you like this, Kinoshita?

287
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,910
I'm only nice to girls I like.

288
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,100
I decided I would go with my dad of my own accord.

289
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,490
This is good bye.

290
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,990
I won't leave you.

291
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,370
I don't know what this is.

Great work on your first day, everyone.

294
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,950
I can't move...

295
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,520
My feet hurt...

296
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,650
The day ended before I could get a handle on things...

297
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,350
I even broke a plate.

298
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,920
Ren, could you organize these for me?

299
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,330
Sure thing.

300
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,840
That broken plate was a real hazard, you know?

301
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,730
I promise I won't break any more.

302
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,910
- You sure?
- Yeah.

303
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,120
I'll do my best not to drag the rest of you down.
